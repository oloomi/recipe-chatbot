Prepare the Vegetables:\n- **Eggplants:** Slice the eggplants into 1/3-inch thick rounds. Salt them generously and let sit for 15 minutes to draw out bitterness. Rinse with cold water and pat dry.\n- **Potatoes:** Peel and slice into 1/4-inch rounds.\n\n#### 2. Roast the Vegetables:\n- Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n- Brush the eggplant and potato slices with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt.\n- Arrange them in a single layer. Roast for about 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden and tender. Set aside.\n\n#### 3. Make the Filling:\n- In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat.\n- Saut\u00e9 the chopped onion until translucent, about 5 minutes.\n- Add the garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n- Stir in the crushed tomatoes, oregano, cinnamon, salt, and pepper.\n- Let simmer gently for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n- Mix in chopped parsley, then remove from heat.\n\n#### 4. Assemble the Moussaka:\n- Lightly oil a suitable baking dish.\n- Layer the roasted potatoes at the bottom.\n- Spread the tomato and vegetable sauce over the potatoes.\n- Add the roasted eggplant slices on top.\n- Sprinkle the grated feta evenly over the top layer.\n\n#### 5. Prepare the B\u00e9chamel Sauce:\n- In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.\n- Whisk in the flour and cook for about 1-2 minutes to make a roux.\n- Gradually whisk in the milk, ensuring no lumps form.\n- Cook until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes, then remove from heat.\n- Stir in nutmeg, salt, and beaten eggs quickly to avoid scrambling.\n- Pour the b\u00e9chamel evenly over the assembled layers.\n\n#### 6. Bake:\n- Reduce oven temperature to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n- Bake uncovered for 40-45 minutes until the top is golden and bubbling.\n- Let rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.\n\nEnjoy this rich, layered Greek vegetarian meal with a simple side salad or crusty bread!
