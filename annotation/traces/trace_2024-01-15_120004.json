Here's how to make it:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 1 cup quinoa\n- 2 cups water or low FODMAP broth (for extra flavor)\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\n- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice\n- 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest\n- 1 teaspoon dried oregano or thyme (check for FODMAP content)\n- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste\n- Optional: chopped fresh chives or parsley for garnish\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Rinse the Quinoa:**  \n   Place the quinoa in a fine mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water for about 30 seconds. This removes saponins, which can cause bitterness.\n\n2. **Cook the Quinoa:**  \n   In a medium saucepan, combine rinsed quinoa and water/broth. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.  \n   Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and simmer for about 15 minutes until the liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy.\n\n3. **Fluff and Season:**  \n   Remove the saucepan from heat. Let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Then, fluff the quinoa with a fork.\n\n4. **Add Flavor:**  \n   Transfer the cooked quinoa to a mixing bowl. While still warm, stir in olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, dried herbs, salt, and pepper. Mix well to evenly distribute the flavors.\n\n5. **Garnish and Serve:**  \n   Top with chopped chives or parsley if available. Serve warm or at room temperature.\n\n### Tips:\n- You can add diced low FODMAP vegetables like carrots or cucumbers for extra crunch.\n- This dish pairs well with grilled chicken or fish for a complete meal.\n\nEnjoy your bright, zesty, and pantry-friendly low FODMAP dish!
