It\u2019s a hearty, high-effort dish that embodies Middle Eastern hospitality, and it should be doable within an hour if you manage your time well. \n\n### **Mansaf \u2013 Middle Eastern Lamb with Rice and Yogurt Sauce**\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 1.5 lbs (700g) lamb (preferably shoulder or shank), cut into chunks\n- 2 cups long-grain rice (preferably Jasmati or Basmati)\n- 1 large onion, sliced\n- 4 cups water or beef/chicken broth\n- 1 cup dried lamb or beef bouillon (optional but adds depth)\n- 1 teaspoon ground allspice\n- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n- 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- 2 tablespoons ghee or olive oil\n- 1 cup jameed (dried fermented yogurt) or 1.5 cups plain Greek yogurt as a substitute\n- 2 cups chopped tomatoes (or canned tomatoes)\n- 1/2 cup pine nuts, toasted\n- Fresh parsley or coriander, chopped for garnish\n- Flatbread or rice for serving\n\n---\n\n### **Preparation Steps:**\n\n#### 1. **Prepare the Lamb Broth and Cook Lamb (30 minutes)**\n- **Start** by heating a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the ghee or olive oil.\n- **Add** the sliced onions and saut\u00e9 until translucent, about 5 minutes.\n- **Add** the lamb chunks, season with salt, pepper, allspice, cinnamon, cumin, and turmeric.\n- **Stir** well to coat the lamb with spices and cook until browned on all sides, about 8-10 minutes.\n- **Pour** in 4 cups of water or broth, add the dried bouillon if using, and bring to a boil.\n- **Reduce** the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the lamb is tender. Skim off any foam or excess fat.\n\n#### 2. **Prepare the Yogurt Sauce (While Lamb Cook)**\n- **In a bowl**, whisk the plain Greek yogurt until smooth.\n- **If using jameed**, soak it in warm water for 10 minutes, then blend with some of the broth to make it smooth.\n- **Add** the yogurt (or jameed mixture) to a pot, warm gently over low heat (do not boil).\n- **Stir in** chopped tomatoes and simmer for 10 minutes to develop flavor. Season with salt to taste.\n- **Set aside**; this will be your tangy yogurt sauce to serve with the rice and lamb.\n\n#### 3. **Cook the Rice (15 minutes)**\n- **While the lamb simmers**, rinse the rice under cold water until clear.\n- **In a separate pot**, add 2 cups of rice, 4 cups of broth from the lamb cooking, a pinch of salt, and a tablespoon of butter or ghee.\n- **Bring to a boil**, then reduce heat to low, cover, and **let it cook** for 15 minutes or until rice is fluffy and the liquid is absorbed.\n\n#### 4. **Toast Pine Nuts and Prepare Garnish**\n- **In a small dry skillet**, toast the pine nuts over medium heat until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes. Be careful not to burn them.\n- **Chop** fresh parsley or coriander for garnish.\n\n#### 5. **Assemble the Mansaf**\n- **On a large serving platter**, spread a layer of flatbread or serve the rice on the side.\n- **Place** the cooked lamb on top.\n- **Pour** the warm yogurt and tomato sauce over the lamb and rice.\n- **Sprinkle** toasted pine nuts and chopped herbs on top.\n\n---\n\n### **Serving Tips:**\n- Traditionally, Mansaf is served family-style with flatbread to scoop everything up.\n- It pairs beautifully with a side of pickles or a fresh salad.\n\n---\n\nWould you like a different recipe or more detailed guidance?"
