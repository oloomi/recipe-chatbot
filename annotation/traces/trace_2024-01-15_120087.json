If using sesame oil, drizzle it in at this stage for added flavor.\n   \n6. **Serve:**\n   - Transfer to a serving dish.\n   - Garnish with sesame seeds or chopped green onions if desired.\n\n**Serve hot** over steamed rice or noodles for a complete meal.\n\nEnjoy your flavorful and healthy egg-free tofu stir-fry!
