Here's a delightful and easy Keto-friendly Italian-inspired Cauliflower, Cheese, and Bacon Casserole \u2014 a comforting dish that's perfect for satisfying your craving for cheesy, savory flavors.\n\n### Italian Cauliflower Cheese & Bacon Casserole\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 1 medium head of cauliflower (cut into small florets)\n- 4 strips of bacon, chopped\n- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese\n- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n- 1 cup heavy cream\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning (or a mix of oregano, basil, thyme)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)\n\n#### Instructions:\n\n1. **Preheat Oven:**  \n   Set your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Lightly grease a baking dish with some butter or non-stick spray.\n\n2. **Cook Cauliflower:**  \n   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the cauliflower florets and cook until just tender, about 5-6 minutes. Drain well and set aside.\n\n3. **Cook Bacon:**  \n   While the cauliflower is boiling, place the chopped bacon in a skillet over medium heat. Cook until crispy, about 6-8 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, leaving the bacon fat in the skillet.\n\n4. **Make the Cheese Sauce:**  \n   In the same skillet with bacon fat, add the minced garlic and saut\u00e9 for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Pour in the heavy cream, stirring constantly. Bring to a gentle simmer, then stir in the Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Lower the heat and mix in 3/4 of the shredded mozzarella and Parmesan cheese, stirring until the cheese melts into a smooth sauce.\n\n5. **Combine & Assemble:**  \n   Add the drained cauliflower and crispy bacon to the cheese sauce. Gently fold to coat everything evenly.\n\n6. **Bake:**  \n   Transfer the mixture into your prepared baking dish, spreading it out evenly. Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella cheese on top.\n\n7. **Bake & Serve:**  \n   Bake uncovered for about 20-25 minutes, or until the top is bubbly and golden. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley before serving.\n\nEnjoy this cheesy, savory, Italian-inspired cauliflower casserole\u2014perfect for a low-carb, comforting meal!
