Marinate the Chicken:\n- In a small bowl, whisk together garlic-infused olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper.\n- Place the chicken breasts in a resealable bag or shallow dish, pour the marinade over them, ensuring they are well coated.\n- Marinate in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours for more flavor.\n\n#### 2. Prepare the Quinoa:\n- Rinse the quinoa under cold water using a fine sieve to remove bitter saponins.\n- In a saucepan, bring 2 cups of water or broth to a boil.\n- Add the quinoa, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes or until water is absorbed.\n- Remove from heat, let cool slightly, then fluff with a fork.\n- In a mixing bowl, combine cooked quinoa, grated carrot, chopped cucumber, and parsley.\n- Drizzle with lemon juice and garlic-infused olive oil, then season with salt and pepper. Toss well.\n\n#### 3. Roast the Vegetables:\n- Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n- Toss zucchini, bell peppers, and cherry tomatoes with garlic-infused olive oil, oregano, salt, and pepper.\n- Spread them evenly on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n- Roast for 20-25 minutes, stirring halfway through, until vegetables are tender and slightly caramelized.\n\n#### 4. Grill the Chicken:\n- Preheat your grill or grill pan over medium-high heat.\n- Remove chicken from marinade and cook for about 6-7 minutes per side, or until the internal temperature reaches 165\u00b0F (75\u00b0C).\n- Let rest for a few minutes before slicing.\n\n#### 5. Assemble the Meal:\n- Plate the grilled chicken slices alongside the quinoa salad and roasted vegetables.\n- Garnish with extra lemon wedges and fresh herbs if desired.\n\n### Tips:\n- Always double-check the ingredients, especially packaged items, for any hidden high-FODMAP ingredients.\n- Feel free to switch out vegetables with others you tolerate well, like green beans or eggplant.\n\nWould you like a different type of complex FODMAP-friendly meal, such as a vegetarian option or a seafood dish?"
