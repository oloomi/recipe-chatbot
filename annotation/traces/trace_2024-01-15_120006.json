        "content": "Absolutely! How about a simple and tasty **Lemon Herb Grilled Chicken**? It's light, beginner-friendly, and low FODMAP. Plus, it uses basic ingredients and no heavy sauces.\n\n### Lemon Herb Grilled Chicken\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\n- 1 tablespoon lemon juice (fresh or bottled)\n- 1 teaspoon dried oregano or thyme\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n- \u00bd teaspoon black pepper\n- Optional: sliced green parts of scallions for garnish\n\n---\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Chicken:**\n   - Pat the chicken breasts dry with paper towels. This helps the marinade stick better.\n   \n2. **Make the Marinade:**\n   - In a small bowl, mix olive oil, lemon juice, dried oregano (or thyme), salt, and black pepper.\n   \n3. **Marinate the Chicken:**\n   - Place the chicken breasts in a shallow dish or a zip-top bag.\n   - Pour the marinade over the chicken, ensuring both sides are coated.\n   - Let it marinate at room temperature for about 15-20 minutes, or refrigerate for up to 2 hours for more flavor.\n   \n4. **Preheat the Grill:**\n   - Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.\n   \n5. **Grill the Chicken:**\n   - Place the chicken breasts on the grill.\n   - Cook for 6-7 minutes on each side, or until the internal temperature reaches 165\u00b0F (75\u00b0C) and the juices run clear.\n   \n6. **Rest and Serve:**\n   - Remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for 5 minutes.\n   - Slice if desired, garnish with sliced green scallion parts, and serve.\n\n---\n\nThis dish pairs well with simple steamed rice or a side of saut\u00e9ed low FODMAP vegetables like spinach or zucchini. It's refreshing, easy to make, and perfect for beginners! Would you like suggestions for side dishes or variations?"
