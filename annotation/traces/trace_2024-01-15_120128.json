Gently mash it with a fork until creamy but still slightly chunky.\n\n3. **Make the lime dressing:**\n   - Zest the lime and set aside.\n   - Juice the lime into a small bowl.\n   - Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil, a pinch of salt and pepper, and the lime zest. Whisk together until well combined.\n\n4. **Combine all ingredients:**\n   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooled quinoa, diced vegetables, and mashed avocado.\n   - Pour the lime dressing over the mixture and gently toss to coat everything evenly.\n\n5. **Adjust seasonings and serve:**\n   - Taste and adjust salt, pepper, or lime juice as needed.\n   - Garnish with chopped fresh herbs if desired.\n   - Serve immediately or chilled for a refreshing meal.\n\nEnjoy this light, gluten-free quinoa and lime salad with creamy avocado!
