        "content": "Absolutely! I recommend trying **Mediterranean Stuffed Bell Peppers**. They're vibrant, flavorful, and packed with nutritious ingredients, perfect for a satisfying vegetarian meal with moderate effort. Here's how to make them:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 4 large bell peppers (any color)\n- 1 cup cooked quinoa or couscous\n- 1 can (15 oz) chickpeas, drained and rinsed\n- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved\n- 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese (optional for extra flavor)\n- 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 2 teaspoons dried oregano or Italian seasoning\n- 1 teaspoon ground cumin (optional)\n- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste\n- Lemon wedges, for serving\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Bell Peppers:**\n   - Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n   - Carefully cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds and membranes. You can save the tops for presentation or chop them and add to the stuffing.\n   - Lightly brush the outside of the peppers with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and place them upright in a baking dish.\n\n2. **Make the Filling:**\n   - In a mixing bowl, combine the cooked quinoa or couscous, chickpeas, cherry tomatoes, feta cheese (if using), parsley, oregano, cumin (if using), 1 tablespoon of olive oil, salt, and pepper. Mix well to combine all ingredients evenly.\n\n3. **Stuff the Peppers:**\n   - Spoon the filling mixture into each bell pepper, packing it gently and filling to the top.\n   - If desired, replace the tops of the peppers to create a more rustic look.\n\n4. **Bake:**\n   - Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 30-35 minutes, until the peppers are tender.\n   - For a slightly roasted top, remove the foil during the last 5 minutes of baking.\n\n5. **Serve:**\n   - Carefully transfer the stuffed peppers to plates.\n   - Garnish with extra parsley and serve with lemon wedges for a fresh burst of flavor.\n\nEnjoy this hearty, colorful Mediterranean dish!
