It\u2019s flavorful, comforting, and uses a few modifications to keep the sodium in check while still delivering authentic taste. Here\u2019s how to make it:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 4 cups low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth\n- 1 cup dried shiitake mushrooms (or fresh if available)\n- 1 cup enoki mushrooms, trimmed\n- 1/2 cup sliced carrots\n- 2 green onions, chopped (white and green parts separated)\n- 2 tablespoons white or red miso paste (look for low-sodium options or use half the amount, tasting as you go)\n- 1 tablespoon soy sauce (low sodium)\n- 1 teaspoon sesame oil\n- 1 teaspoon grated ginger\n- Optional: a small block of firm tofu, cubed (be sure to rinse well)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Hydrate the Mushrooms:**\n   - Place the dried shiitake mushrooms in a bowl and cover with hot water. Let them soak for about 20-30 minutes until softened.\n   - Once hydrated, remove the mushrooms, reserving the soaking liquid (strain it to remove any grit). Slice the shiitake caps thinly.\n\n2. **Prepare the Broth:**\n   - In a pot, bring the low-sodium broth to a gentle simmer.\n   - Add the soaked shiitake slices, sliced carrots, and the mushroom soaking liquid (about 1-2 cups). Let simmer for 10 minutes to develop flavor.\n\n3. **Incorporate Flavor:**\n   - In a small bowl, whisk the miso paste with a few spoons of hot broth until smooth. This prevents clumping.\n   - Add the miso mixture to the pot, stirring gently. Be sure not to boil the soup after adding miso; high heat can diminish its beneficial probiotics.\n\n4. **Add Tofu and Green Onions:**\n   - Gently add the cubed tofu if using, allowing it to warm through for about 2-3 minutes.\n   - Add the chopped green onion whites and stir in the sesame oil for aroma and depth.\n\n5. **Final Touches:**\n   - Taste the soup and add the low-sodium soy sauce gradually, adjusting to your preference. Remember, it\u2019s low-sodium, so start small.\n   - Turn off the heat and serve hot, garnished with the green part of the onions.\n\n### Tips for Success:\n- Use freshly grated ginger for a bright, spicy note.\n- Adjust the amount of miso based on your salt preference\u2014start small and taste as you go.\n- Serve with a side of steamed rice if desired for a complete meal.\n\nThis recipe is both flavorful and heartwarming, with a delicate umami that\u2019s perfect for a low-sodium diet.
