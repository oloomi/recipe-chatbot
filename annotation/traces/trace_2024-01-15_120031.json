It combines tender beef tenderloin, flavorful mushroom duxelles, and a crisp almond flour pastry\u2014everyone will be impressed! Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 1.5 to 2 lb beef tenderloin (center-cut)\n- Salt and freshly ground black pepper\n- 2 tbsp olive oil\n- 2 tbsp Dijon mustard\n- 8 oz cremini or shiitake mushrooms, finely chopped\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 2 tbsp unsalted butter\n- 1 small shallot, minced\n- 2 oz prosciutto slices\n- 1 cup almond flour\n- 1 large egg\n- \u00bd tsp baking powder\n- \u00bc tsp xanthan gum (optional, for structure)\n- 1 tbsp cold water\n- 1 tbsp heavy cream (for egg wash)\n- Fresh thyme (optional)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n#### Step 1: Prepare the Beef\n1. **Season the tenderloin** generously with salt and pepper all over.\n2. In a heavy skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering.\n3. Sear the beef on all sides until browned\u2014about 2-3 minutes per side. Use a meat thermometer; aim for 125\u00b0F for rare or adjust to your preference.\n4. Remove from heat, let rest for 10 minutes.\n5. Brush all over with Dijon mustard, coating evenly. Set aside.\n\n#### Step 2: Make the Mushroom Duxelles\n1. In the same skillet, melt butter over medium heat.\n2. Add minced shallots and garlic; saut\u00e9 until fragrant, about 2 minutes.\n3. Add chopped mushrooms, cook until moisture evaporates and mixture reduces, about 8-10 minutes.\n4. Season with salt, pepper, and thyme if using. Cool the mushroom mixture.\n\n#### Step 3: Prepare Almond Flour Pastry\n1. In a bowl, combine almond flour, baking powder, and xanthan gum.\n2. Stir in the egg, cold water, and heavy cream until forming a dough.\n3. Knead briefly until smooth; wrap in plastic and chill for 15 minutes.\n\n#### Step 4: Assemble the Wellington\n1. Roll out the almond flour pastry between two sheets of parchment paper into a rectangle large enough to wrap the beef.\n2. Lay prosciutto slices on a sheet of plastic wrap, slightly overlapping.\n3. Spread the mushroom duxelles on prosciutto, then place the beef in the center.\n4. Use the plastic wrap to help roll the prosciutto and mushroom layer around the beef, forming a tight log. Chill again for 10 minutes.\n5. Unwrap the pastry. Place the mushroom-wrapped beef in the center.\n6. Carefully roll the pastry around the beef, sealing edges with a bit of egg wash.\n7. Trim excess pastry for a neat look and decorate if desired.\n\n#### Step 5: Bake\n1. Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n2. Brush the pastry with a beaten egg wash for a golden finish.\n3. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.\n4. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown and crisp.\n\n#### Step 6: Rest and Serve\n1. Let the Beef Wellington rest for 10 minutes before slicing.\n2. Serve slices with a sugar-free gravy or a keto-friendly sauce of your choice.\n\n---\n\nThis recipe demands attention to detail but results in a show-stopping, keto-friendly gourmet dinner.
