        "content": "Certainly! Here's a simple and delicious Kosher **Garlic & Olive Oil Spaghetti (Aglio e Olio)** that you can make in under an hour with basic pantry ingredients.\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 12 oz (340 g) spaghetti or your preferred pasta\n- 3-4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced\n- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil\n- Red pepper flakes (optional, for a bit of heat)\n- Salt\n- Freshly ground black pepper\n- Fresh parsley or basil (if available), chopped, for garnish\n- Grated Parmesan or Pecorino cheese (if available and needs to be Kosher certified)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Cook the Pasta:**\n   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Use about 1-2 tablespoons of salt to flavor the pasta.\n   - Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente (usually about 8-10 minutes).\n   - Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta and set aside.\n\n2. **Prepare the Garlic & Oil:**\n   - While the pasta cooks, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.\n   - Add the sliced garlic to the oil. Cook gently, stirring frequently, until the garlic turns golden and fragrant \u2013 about 2-3 minutes. Be careful not to burn the garlic, as that can cause bitterness.\n   - If you like some heat, add a pinch of red pepper flakes at this point.\n\n3. **Toss the Pasta:**\n   - Add the drained pasta to the skillet with garlic and oil. Toss well to coat all the noodles.\n   - If needed, add a splash of the reserved pasta water to loosen the sauce and help it cling to the pasta.\n\n4. **Season & Garnish:**\n   - Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.\n   - If you have fresh herbs, sprinkle chopped parsley or basil over the top.\n   - Optionally, add a little grated cheese if available and certified Kosher.\n\n5. **Serve:**\n   - Serve immediately while hot. Optionally, sprinkle with more herbs or cheese before serving.\n\nThis dish is quick, flavorful, and relies on simple ingredients you likely already have!
