        "content": "Certainly! Here's a sophisticated and flavorful recipe for **Lemon Herb Salmon with Asparagus**. This dish combines tender, flaky salmon with bright lemon and fresh herbs, served alongside perfectly roasted asparagus. It's perfect for a special occasion or a refined weeknight dinner.\n\n---\n\n### Lemon Herb Salmon with Roasted Asparagus\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 4 salmon fillets (about 6 oz each)\n- 1 bunch asparagus (roughly 1 pound)\n- 2 lemons (1 for juice, 1 sliced for garnish)\n- 3 garlic cloves, minced\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 1 teaspoon dried thyme or fresh thyme sprigs\n- 1 teaspoon dried dill or fresh dill\n- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste\n- Optional: lemon zest for extra brightness\n- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)\n\n---\n\n### Instructions:\n\n#### 1. Prepare the Salmon:\n- In a small bowl, combine the juice of one lemon, minced garlic, 1 tablespoon olive oil, thyme, dill, salt, and pepper.\n- Place the salmon fillets on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or lightly greased.\n- Brush or spoon the lemon herb mixture evenly over each fillet, making sure to coat the top and sides.\n- If using fresh thyme sprigs, lay them on top of the salmon for added flavor.\n- Let the salmon marinate for 10-15 minutes at room temperature.\n\n#### 2. Roast the Asparagus:\n- Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n- While the salmon marinates, trim the tough ends off the asparagus.\n- Toss the asparagus in the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, a pinch of salt, and freshly ground black pepper.\n- Spread the asparagus in a single layer on a separate baking sheet or in a roasting dish.\n- Place in the oven for about 12-15 minutes, or until tender and slightly caramelized at the tips.\n\n#### 3. Bake the Salmon:\n- Once the oven is preheated, place the salmon in the oven with the asparagus.\n- Bake for 12-15 minutes, depending on thickness, until the salmon flakes easily with a fork.\n- For extra flavor and a crispy top, you can turn on the broiler for the last 2 minutes, watching closely.\n\n#### 4. Garnish and Serve:\n- Remove both dishes from the oven.\n- Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the salmon and asparagus.\n- Garnish with lemon slices and chopped fresh parsley.\n- Plate the salmon alongside the roasted asparagus and serve immediately.\n\n---\n\n### Serving Suggestions:\nThis dish pairs beautifully with a light quinoa or wild rice salad, or creamy mashed potatoes for a more hearty experience.\n\nEnjoy the bright, fresh flavors of this elegant pescatarian dish!
