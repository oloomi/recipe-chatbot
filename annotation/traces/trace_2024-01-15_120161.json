        "content": "A fantastic and flavorful vegetarian Greek dish you can try at home is Greek Spanakopita (Spinach Pie). It\u2019s made with simple ingredients and offers a delicious combination of healthy greens and crispy, flaky pastry. Here's a straightforward recipe:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 1 package (about 16 oz) frozen spinach (thawed and drained)\n- 1 large onion, finely chopped\n- 2-3 scallions, chopped (optional)\n- 2-3 garlic cloves, minced\n- 1/2 cup fresh dill, chopped (or 1 teaspoon dried dill)\n- 1/2 cup feta cheese, crumbled\n- 2 large eggs\n- 1/4 cup olive oil\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- 1 package phyllo (filo) pastry sheets (thawed if frozen)\n- Additional olive oil or melted butter for brushing\n\n---\n\n### Instructions:\n\n**1. Prepare the filling:**\n- In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat.\n- Add the chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.\n- Add the minced garlic and scallions (if using), cook for another minute until fragrant.\n- Squeeze out excess moisture from the thawed spinach, then add it to the skillet.\n- Cook everything together for 2-3 minutes, stirring well.\n- Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.\n- In a mixing bowl, combine the saut\u00e9ed vegetables, crumbled feta, chopped dill, eggs, 2 tablespoons olive oil, salt, and pepper. Mix thoroughly.\n\n**2. Prepare the phyllo:**\n- Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).\n- Lightly grease a baking dish with olive oil or butter.\n- Carefully unroll the phyllo sheets. Cover them with a damp cloth to prevent drying out.\n\n**3. Assemble the pie:**\n- Lay one sheet of phyllo in the prepared dish, brushing it lightly with olive oil or melted butter.\n- Repeat layering with about 4-5 sheets, brushing each sheet.\n- Spread the spinach and feta filling evenly over the layered phyllo.\n- Continue layering more sheets on top, again brushing each sheet with oil to ensure crispiness. Use about another 4-5 sheets.\n- Finish with a top layer of brushed phyllo sheets.\n\n**4. Bake:**\n- Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for approximately 30-40 minutes, until the top is golden brown.\n- Remove from the oven and let it sit for 5 minutes before slicing.\n\n**5. Serve:**\n- Cut into squares or wedges and enjoy warm or at room temperature.\n\nThis Greek spinach pie is delicious on its own or paired with a fresh side salad. It\u2019s a great vegetarian option packed with flavor and texture!"
