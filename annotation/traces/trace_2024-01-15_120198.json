It combines tender eggplant with seasoned ground turkey, topped with cheese if you'd like, for a satisfying meal.\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 2 medium eggplants\n- 1 pound ground turkey\n- 1 small onion, finely chopped\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika\n- 1 teaspoon dried oregano\n- \u00bd teaspoon chili powder (optional for a kick)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- \u00bd cup shredded cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, or feta\u2014optional)\n- Fresh parsley or basil for garnish (optional)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Preheat and Prepare Eggplants:**  \n   Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). Wash the eggplants and cut each in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, carefully scoop out the flesh, leaving about \u00bd-inch border to keep the boats sturdy. Chop the scooped-out eggplant flesh and set aside.\n\n2. **Bake Eggplant Shells:**  \n   Lightly brush the eggplant shells with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 15 minutes to soften.\n\n3. **Cook the Filling:**  \n   While the shells bake, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 2-3 minutes until translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook another minute until fragrant.\n\n4. **Add Ground Turkey and Spices:**  \n   Increase heat to medium-high. Add the ground turkey to the skillet, breaking it apart with a spatula. Cook for about 6-8 minutes until browned and cooked through. Stir in smoked paprika, oregano, chili powder (if using), salt, and pepper.\n\n5. **Combine with Eggplant Flesh:**  \n   Add the chopped eggplant flesh to the skillet. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the eggplant is tender and the mixture is well combined.\n\n6. **Fill Eggplant Shells:**  \n   Spoon the hot turkey and eggplant mixture into the pre-baked eggplant shells evenly. If desired, sprinkle cheese on top of each stuffed eggplant.\n\n7. **Bake the Filled Eggplants:**  \n   Return the stuffed eggplants to the oven and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the cheese (if added) is melted and bubbly.\n\n8. **Serve:**  \n   Garnish with chopped fresh parsley or basil if available. Serve hot, and enjoy a hearty, low-carb meal!\n\nWould you like suggestions for variations or a different type of recipe?"
