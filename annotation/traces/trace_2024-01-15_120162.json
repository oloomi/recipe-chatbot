        "content": "Absolutely! A wonderful nut-free Mexican dish that balances flavor and complexity without being overwhelming is **Chicken Enchiladas with Green Sauce**. This dish offers a delightful combination of tender chicken, rich green sauce, and melted cheese encased in soft corn tortillas. It\u2019s flavorful, satisfying, and avoids nuts entirely.\n\nHere\u2019s an in-depth, step-by-step guide to crafting these delicious enchiladas:\n\n---\n\n### Ingredients:\n\n**For the Filling:**\n- 2 chicken breasts (about 1 pound), boneless and skinless\n- 1 small onion, diced\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- 1 teaspoon cumin powder\n- 1 teaspoon paprika (optional)\n- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n\n**For the Green Sauce:**\n- 4-5 large tomatillos, husked and rinsed\n- 1 small onion, quartered\n- 2 cloves garlic\n- 1 jalape\u00f1o (seeded if less heat is desired)\n- 1/2 cup fresh cilantro leaves\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n- 1 teaspoon sugar (to balance acidity)\n- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil or butter\n- 1/2 cup chicken broth (or water)\n\n**For Assembly:**\n- 8-10 corn tortillas\n- 1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar, Monterey Jack, or a blend)\n- Fresh cilantro for garnish\n- Sour cream or Mexican crema (optional)\n- Diced onion and sliced radishes for garnish (optional)\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step Instructions:\n\n#### 1. **Cook the Chicken:**\n- **Poaching Method:** Place the chicken breasts in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Add a pinch of salt and a halved onion if desired for extra flavor. Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat, then reduce heat to low and simmer until cooked through (about 15-20 minutes). Remove from water and let cool slightly.\n- **Shredding:** Once cool enough to handle, shred the chicken using two forks or your hands. Set aside.\n\n#### 2. **Prepare the Green Sauce:**\n- **Roasting the Vegetables:** Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Spread the tomatillos, quartered onion, garlic cloves, and jalape\u00f1o on a baking sheet. Roast for about 15 minutes until the tomatillos are soft and slightly charred.\n- **Blending:** Transfer roasted vegetables to a blender. Add the cilantro, salt, sugar, and chicken broth. Blend until smooth. Adjust seasoning as needed. If the sauce is too thick, add a little more broth.\n\n#### 3. **Cook the Filling:**\n- In a skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium heat.\n- Add the diced onion and cook until translucent, about 3-4 minutes.\n- Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n- Stir in the shredded chicken, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper. Mix well and cook for 2-3 minutes to heat through and combine flavors.\n- Remove from heat.\n\n#### 4. **Prepare the Tortillas:**\n- To prevent cracking and make rolling easier, warm your tortillas slightly. Wrap them in a damp cloth and microwave for 30 seconds until soft and pliable.\n\n#### 5. **Assemble the Enchiladas:**\n- Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n- Spread a thin layer of green sauce on the bottom of a baking dish.\n- Take one tortilla, add about 2-3 tablespoons of the chicken filling in the center, and sprinkle with a bit of shredded cheese.\n- Roll the tortilla tightly and place it seam-side down in the baking dish.\n- Repeat with remaining tortillas, arranging them closely together.\n\n#### 6. **Add the Sauce and Cheese:**\n- Pour the remaining green sauce evenly over the assembled enchiladas.\n- Sprinkle the top generously with extra shredded cheese.\n\n#### 7. **Bake:**\n- Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.\n- Bake for 20-25 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly.\n- Remove foil in the last 5 minutes if you want a slightly crispy top.\n\n#### 8. **Garnish and Serve:**\n- Let the enchiladas rest for 5 minutes after baking.\n- Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro, sliced radishes, diced onions, and a dollop of sour cream or crema if desired.\n- Serve hot, accompanied by rice or beans for a complete meal.\n\n---\n\n### Tips:\n- **Vegetarian Version:** Replace the chicken with black beans or roasted vegetables.\n- **Spicy Heat:** Keep or increase the jalape\u00f1o for more heat, or add a dash of hot sauce.\n- **Make Ahead:** Assemble the dish and refrigerate\u2014bake just before serving.\n\nEnjoy your homemade, nut-free Mexican Chicken Enchiladas with Green Sauce! They\u2019re full of vibrant flavors and textures that are sure to impress. Would you like a recipe for a side dish to go along with this?"
