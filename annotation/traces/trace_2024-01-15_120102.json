Roast the Asparagus:\n- Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n- Wash the asparagus and trim about 1 inch from the woody ends.\n- Spread the asparagus on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n- Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.\n- Toss gently to coat, then arrange in a single layer.\n- Roast for about 12-15 minutes until tender and slightly caramelized.\n\n#### 3. Cook the Salmon:\n- While the asparagus roasts, heat a large ovenproof skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat with a teaspoon of olive oil.\n- Remove the salmon from the marinade, letting excess drip off.\n- When the pan is hot, carefully place salmon fillets skin-side down (if they have skin). Sear for about 3-4 minutes until golden.\n- Flip the fillets gently and cook for another 2 minutes.\n- Transfer the skillet to the oven (if your skillet is ovenproof) or transfer the salmon to a baking dish.\n- Roast for an additional 8-10 minutes, or until the salmon easily flakes with a fork.\n\n#### 4. Finish with Lemon:\n- Remove the salmon from the oven, squeeze fresh lemon juice over the fillets, and add lemon slices for garnish.\n- Serve the salmon alongside the roasted asparagus, garnished with additional herbs or capers if desired.\n\n### Presentation:\nPlate the salmon fillets with the roasted asparagus on the side. You can add a wedge of lemon or some chopped fresh herbs for an extra touch.\n\nEnjoy your advanced lemon-infused salmon with perfectly roasted asparagus\u2014a dish that\u2019s both elegant and full of vibrant flavors!
