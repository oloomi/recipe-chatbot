Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n### Spinach and Egg Frittata\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 4 large eggs\n- 1 cup fresh spinach, chopped\n- \u00bd cup grated cheese (such as Parmesan, mozzarella, or any cheese you like)\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\n- Salt and black pepper to taste\n\n---\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Preheat the Oven:**\n   - Set your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). This will help finish cooking the frittata evenly.\n\n2. **Prepare the Spinach:**\n   - Wash the spinach thoroughly.\n   - In a skillet (preferably oven-safe), heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat.\n   - Add the chopped spinach and saut\u00e9 for about 2-3 minutes until wilted.\n   - Remove from heat and set aside.\n\n3. **Mix the Eggs:**\n   - In a mixing bowl, crack the 4 eggs.\n   - Whisk the eggs thoroughly until the yolks and whites are combined.\n   - Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.\n   - Stir in the grated cheese and the saut\u00e9ed spinach.\n\n4. **Cook the Frittata:**\n   - In the same skillet, ensure the spinach and cheese are evenly distributed.\n   - Pour the egg mixture over the spinach in the skillet.\n   - Let it cook over medium heat for about 2-3 minutes until the edges start to set.\n\n5. **Bake in the Oven:**\n   - Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven.\n   - Bake for 10-12 minutes until the eggs are fully set and slightly puffed.\n   - You can check doneness by inserting a toothpick; it should come out clean.\n\n6. **Serve:**\n   - Carefully remove the skillet from the oven.\n   - Let the frittata cool slightly for a few minutes.\n   - Slice into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature.\n\nEnjoy your simple and tasty Spinach and Egg Frittata\u2014perfect for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!
