It's protein-packed, fresh, and easy to make!\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 1 cup quinoa\n- 1 can black beans (15 oz), drained and rinsed\n- 1 ripe avocado\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\n- 1 lime\n- 1 teaspoon cumin\n- 1 teaspoon chili powder\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Optional: chopped cilantro, jalape\u00f1o slices, hot sauce\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Cook the Quinoa:**\n   - Rinse the quinoa thoroughly under cold water using a fine mesh strainer.\n   - In a medium saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil.\n   - Add the rinsed quinoa, a pinch of salt, and reduce the heat to low.\n   - Cover and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until all water is absorbed.\n   - Remove from heat and let it sit covered for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork.\n\n2. **Prepare the Black Beans:**\n   - While the quinoa is cooking, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat.\n   - Add the drained black beans, cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper.\n   - Stir to combine and cook for about 5 minutes, until warmed through. For extra flavor, you can squeeze a little lime juice over the beans. Set aside.\n\n3. **Prepare the Avocado:**\n   - While the beans are cooking, cut the avocado in half, remove the pit, and scoop the flesh into a bowl.\n   - Mash it slightly with a fork, or slice it if you prefer a chunkier texture.\n   - Squeeze the juice of half a lime over the avocado to prevent browning and add a burst of flavor. Mix gently.\n\n4. **Assemble the Bowls:**\n   - Divide the cooked quinoa into bowls.\n   - Top each with the warm black beans.\n   - Add sliced or mashed avocado on top.\n   - Garnish with chopped cilantro, jalape\u00f1o slices, or a drizzle of hot sauce if desired.\n\n5. **Serve:**\n   - Squeeze additional lime juice over the top before eating for extra zing.\n\nEnjoy your protein-rich, satisfying Mexican Quinoa, Black Bean, and Avocado Bowl!
