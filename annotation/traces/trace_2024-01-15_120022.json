It's rich, cheesy, and packed with flavor, perfect for a special occasion. Here's how to make it:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 1 lb (450g) ground beef (or ground turkey/lamb if preferred)\n- 1 medium cauliflower head (about 4 cups florets)\n- 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese\n- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n- 1/2 cup heavy cream\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 1 small onion, finely chopped\n- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 teaspoon dried thyme\n- 1 teaspoon paprika\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Fresh parsley for garnish (optional)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n**1. Prepare the Cauliflower:**\n- Cut the cauliflower into florets, then steam or boil until tender, about 5-7 minutes.\n- Drain well and pat dry with a towel to remove excess moisture.\n- Mash the cauliflower slightly with a fork for a rice-like texture, or leave some larger pieces for a variety of textures.\n\n**2. Cook the Meat:**\n- In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat.\n- Add the chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 3-4 minutes.\n- Add the minced garlic, cooking for another minute until fragrant.\n- Add the ground beef, breaking it apart with a spatula. Season with salt, pepper, thyme, and paprika.\n- Cook until browned and cooked through, about 8-10 minutes.\n- Drain any excess fat if necessary.\n\n**3. Combine and Build the Casserole:**\n- Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n- In a large bowl, mix the cooked cauliflower with the heavy cream, half of the shredded cheddar, and Parmesan cheese. Stir until well combined.\n- Spread the cauliflower mixture evenly in a greased baking dish.\n- Top with the cooked ground beef mixture.\n- Sprinkle the remaining cheddar cheese all over the top for that cheesy crust.\n\n**4. Bake:**\n- Place the casserole in the preheated oven.\n- Bake uncovered for 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the top is golden brown.\n\n**5. Serve:**\n- Garnish with freshly chopped parsley if desired.\n- Let it sit for 5 minutes before serving to set.\n\nThis Beef Cauliflower Bake is rich, satisfying, and perfect for impressing friends with a low-carb, flavorful dish.
