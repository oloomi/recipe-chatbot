Fry the eggplant slices until golden brown on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side.\n6. Remove excess oil with paper towels and set aside.\n\n#### Step 2: Cook the Lamb Mixture\n1. In the same skillet, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil.\n2. Add the chopped onion and saut\u00e9 until translucent, about 5 minutes.\n3. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.\n4. Stir in the ground lamb, breaking it apart with a spatula.\n5. Cook until browned and cooked through, about 8 minutes.\n6.

Add flour and whisk continuously for 1-2 minutes to make a roux.\n3. Gradually add warm milk, whisking constantly to prevent lumps.\n4. Cook until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.\n5. Season with salt, pepper, a pinch of nutmeg, and cheese if using.\n\n#### Step 5: Bake\n1. Pour the b\u00e9chamel sauce evenly over the assembled layers.\n2. Bake in the preheated oven for about 30-35 minutes, until the top is golden and bubbling.\n\n#### Step 6: Serve\n- Let the moussaka rest for 10 minutes before serving.\n- Garnish with chopped parsley for freshness.\n\n---\n\nEnjoy your sophisticated Middle Eastern Lamb and Eggplant Moussaka \u2014 perfect to impress guests or for a hearty family dinner!
