Here's a simple and flavorful dairy-free chicken curry recipe you can try:\n\n**Easy Dairy-Free Chicken Curry**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 1 lb (450g) boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces\n- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil (such as coconut or olive oil)\n- 1 large onion, finely chopped\n- 3 garlic cloves, minced\n- 1-inch piece of fresh ginger, grated\n- 2 tablespoons curry powder (mild or spicy, based on preference)\n- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric\n- 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n- 1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes\n- 1 can (13.5 oz) coconut milk (full fat or light)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Fresh cilantro for garnishing (optional)\n- Cooked rice or flatbread for serving\n\n---\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Prepare your ingredients:** Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. Finely chop the onion, and mince the garlic and ginger.\n\n2. **Saut\u00e9 the aromatics:** Warm the vegetable oil in a large skillet or pot over medium heat.

Stir well to combine.\n\n7. **Simmer:** Bring the mixture to a gentle boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for 20 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld and the chicken to cook through.\n\n8. **Season:** Taste the curry and add salt and pepper as needed.\n\n9. **Serve:** Garnish with chopped cilantro if desired. Serve hot over cooked rice or with flatbread.\n\nEnjoy your flavorful, dairy-free chicken curry! Let me know if you'd like a vegetarian version or something more specific."
