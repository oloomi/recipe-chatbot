        "content": "Certainly! I recommend making a **Savory Lentil and Spinach Stew** \u2014 a hearty, nutritious dish that's perfect for diabetics, not sweet, and packed with flavor. It\u2019s flexible in cooking time, so you can make it quicker or let it simmer longer for deeper flavors. Here's the step-by-step recipe:\n\n### Savory Lentil and Spinach Stew\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 1 cup dried lentils (green or brown)\n- 2 cups fresh spinach, chopped\n- 2 large tomatoes, diced\n- 1 medium onion, chopped\n- 3 garlic cloves, minced\n- 1 tbsp olive oil\n- 1 tsp cumin seeds or ground cumin\n- 1 tsp paprika (optional, for flavor)\n- 1/2 tsp turmeric (adds color and health benefits)\n- 4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth or water\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- A squeeze of lemon (optional, for taste at the end)\n- Red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper (optional, for a bit of heat)\n\n---\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Lentils:**  \n   Rinse the lentils thoroughly under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain and set aside.\n\n2. **Saut\u00e9 Aromatics:**  \n   In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and saut\u00e9 for about 5 minutes until it becomes translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute, stirring constantly to prevent it from burning.\n\n3. **Add Spices and Tomatoes:**  \n   Stir in cumin seeds or ground cumin, paprika, turmeric, and optional red pepper flakes. Let them toast gently for 30 seconds to release their aroma. Then, add the diced tomatoes. Cook for about 5-7 minutes until the tomatoes soften and start to break down, creating a flavorful base.\n\n4. **Cook the Lentils:**  \n   Pour in the vegetable broth or water and add the rinsed lentils. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover partially and let it simmer gently for 25-30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender but not mushy. Stir occasionally. If you want a thicker stew, let it simmer uncovered for an additional 5-10 minutes.\n\n5. **Add Spinach:**  \n   Once the lentils are cooked, stir in the chopped spinach. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the spinach wilts and blends into the stew.\n\n6. **Season and Finish:**  \n   Taste the stew and add salt and pepper as needed. For added brightness, squeeze a little lemon juice over the stew before serving.\n\n7. **Serve:**  \n   Ladle the stew into bowls. It\u2019s delicious on its own or served over a small portion of whole grain like quinoa or brown rice for extra fiber.\n\n---\n\n### Tips:\n- You can make this in advance and keep it refrigerated. Reheat gently on the stove.\n- For extra flavor, garnish with fresh herbs like parsley or cilantro before serving.\n\nThis dish is full of fiber, antioxidants, and flavor without any added sugars, making it perfect for a diabetic-friendly, savory meal.
