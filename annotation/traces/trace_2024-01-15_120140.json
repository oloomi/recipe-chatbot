        "content": "Absolutely! Here's a flavorful **Creamy Coconut Chicken and Spinach Skillet** that is dairy-free, rich, and perfect for an intermediate cook. It combines tender chicken, creamy coconut milk, and nutritious spinach for a satisfying meal.\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (or thighs)\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\n- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 small onion, finely chopped\n- 1 can (13.5 oz) coconut milk (full-fat for creaminess)\n- 2 cups fresh spinach, roughly chopped\n- 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika\n- \u00bd teaspoon turmeric powder (optional, for color and flavor)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Juice of \u00bd lime (optional, for brightness)\n- Fresh cilantro for garnish (optional)\n\n---\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Chicken:**\n   - Pat the chicken breasts dry with paper towels. Slice them into strips or bite-sized pieces.\n   - Season generously with salt, pepper, cumin, and smoked paprika, ensuring the pieces are well-coated with the spices.\n\n2. **Cook the Chicken:**\n   - Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.\n   - Once hot, add the chicken pieces. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, turning occasionally, until they develop a golden-brown exterior and are cooked through (internal temperature of 165\u00b0F). Remove the cooked chicken and set aside.\n\n3. **Saut\u00e9 Aromatics:**\n   - In the same skillet, add the chopped onion and cook for 2-3 minutes until translucent.\n   - Add the minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds to 1 minute until fragrant.\n\n4. **Create the Coconut Sauce:**\n   - Pour in the coconut milk, stirring to scrape up any flavorful browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.\n   - Add turmeric if using, and stir to combine.\n   - Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, allowing it to thicken slightly, about 5 minutes.\n\n5. **Add the Spinach and Chicken:**\n   - Stir in the chopped spinach and cook until wilted, about 2-3 minutes.\n   - Return the cooked chicken to the skillet, mixing well so the chicken is coated with the coconut sauce.\n   - Let everything simmer together for an additional 2 minutes to meld flavors.\n\n6. **Finish and Serve:**\n   - Squeeze the lime juice over the dish for a bright finish (optional).\n   - Taste and adjust salt and pepper as needed.\n   - Garnish with fresh cilantro if you like.\n\n### Serving suggestions:\nServe this savory sauce over cooked rice, cauliflower rice, or your preferred grain. It pairs beautifully with roasted vegetables or a fresh side salad.\n\nEnjoy your creamy, dairy-free Coconut Chicken and Spinach skillet \u2014 a delightful, healthy meal with complex flavors!
