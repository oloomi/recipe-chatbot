        "content": "Absolutely! I recommend trying a **Paleo Stuffed Bell Peppers** recipe. It's hearty, flavorful, and uses common pantry ingredients with fresh produce. Here\u2019s how to make it:\n\n### Paleo Stuffed Bell Peppers\n\n**Ingredients (for 4 servings):**\n- 4 large bell peppers (any color)\n- 1 lb ground beef or ground turkey\n- 1 small onion, finely chopped\n- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 cup cauliflower rice (if you don't have cauliflower rice, pulse cauliflower florets in a food processor until rice-sized)\n- 1 can diced tomatoes (no added sugar)\n- 1 teaspoon dried oregano\n- 1 teaspoon dried thyme\n- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- 2 tbsp olive oil\n- Fresh parsley or cilantro for garnish (optional)\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Peppers:**  \n   - Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).  \n   - Slice the tops off the bell peppers and remove seeds and membranes carefully.  \n   - Lightly brush the outside of the peppers with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and place them in a baking dish. Set aside.\n\n2. **Cook the Filling:**  \n   - In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat.  \n   - Add chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 3-4 minutes.  \n   - Add minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.  \n   - Increase heat to medium-high, add ground beef (or turkey), and cook until browned and fully cooked through. Break up the meat with a spatula as it cooks.  \n   - Stir in cauliflower rice, diced tomatoes (with juices), oregano, thyme, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper.  \n   - Let it simmer uncovered for about 10 minutes, allowing flavors to meld and excess moisture to evaporate slightly.  \n\n3. **Stuff the Peppers:**  \n   - Spoon the filling mixture into each hollowed-out bell pepper generously.  \n   - Cover the baking dish with foil.  \n\n4. **Bake:**  \n   - Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, until peppers are tender and slightly roasted.  \n   - Remove the foil and bake for an additional 5 minutes if you want slightly charred tops.\n\n5. **Serve:**  \n   - Garnish with chopped parsley or cilantro if desired.  \n   - Serve hot, perhaps with a side of mixed greens or a simple Paleo-friendly salad.\n\nEnjoy your flavorful, hearty Paleo stuffed peppers!
