Here's a simple and delicious quick lemon garlic salmon with asparagus recipe:\n\n**Lemon Garlic Salmon with Asparagus**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 2 salmon fillets\n- 1 bunch fresh asparagus (about 1 bunch or 1 cup trimmed)\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 3 garlic cloves, minced\n- 1 lemon (zested and juiced)\n- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste\n- Optional: red pepper flakes for a spicy touch\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the asparagus:**\n   - Rinse the asparagus under cold water.\n   - Trim the tough ends (about 1-2 inches from the bottom).\n   \n2. **Cook the asparagus:**\n   - Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.\n   - Add the asparagus and saut\u00e9 for about 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n   - Add a pinch of salt and pepper.\n   - Remove from skillet and set aside.\n\n3. **Cook the salmon:**\n   - Season the salmon fillets generously with salt, black pepper, and lemon zest.\n   - In the same skillet, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat.\n   - When hot, add the salmon fillets skin-side down (if skin-on).\n   - Cook for about 4-5 minutes without moving, until the skin crisps up.\n   - Flip the salmon and cook for another 3-4 minutes, until just opaque and flaky.\n\n4. **Make the lemon garlic sauce:**\n   - Lower the heat to medium.\n   - Add the minced garlic to the skillet with the salmon drippings.\n   - Saut\u00e9 for about 30 seconds until fragrant.\n   - Squeeze in the lemon juice and sprinkle with lemon zest.\n   - Stir briefly to combine, then spoon the sauce over the salmon.\n\n5. **Combine and serve:**\n   - Return the saut\u00e9ed asparagus to the skillet with the salmon, or serve side by side on a plate.\n   - Optionally, sprinkle with red pepper flakes for some heat.\n   - Serve immediately, maybe with a wedge of lemon for extra brightness.\n\nThis dish is quick (around 20 minutes), healthy, and bursting with fresh citrus flavor!
