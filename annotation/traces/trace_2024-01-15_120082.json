Here's a vibrant and quick Asian-style Tofu and Bell Pepper Stir-Fry that's perfect for a flavorful meal with minimal prep.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 14 oz firm tofu\n- 1 large bell pepper (any color), sliced thinly\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 tablespoon soy sauce\n- 1 tablespoon oyster sauce (or vegetarian oyster sauce if preferred)\n- 1 teaspoon sesame oil\n- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil\n- 1 teaspoon cornstarch (optional, for crisping tofu)\n- 1 teaspoon sugar (optional, for balance)\n- Green onions for garnish (optional)\n- Red chili flakes or fresh chili (optional, if you like some heat)\n  \n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Tofu:**\n   - Drain the tofu and wrap it in paper towels. Place a heavy object on top and press for about 10 minutes to remove excess moisture.\n   - Once pressed, cut the tofu into small cubes or rectangular pieces, depending on your preference.\n   - If you like crispy tofu, toss the tofu pieces in a teaspoon of cornstarch until evenly coated.\n\n2. **Cook the Tofu:**\n   - Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.\n   - Add the tofu cubes in a single layer. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side until golden brown and crispy. Remove and set aside.\n\n3. **Stir-Fry the Bell Peppers & Garlic:**\n   - In the same pan, add a little more oil if needed.\n   - Add the minced garlic and cook for about 30 seconds until fragrant.\n   - Toss in the sliced bell peppers and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until they are just tender but still crisp.\n\n4. **Combine & Season:**\n   - Return the crispy tofu to the skillet with the peppers.\n   - Add soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, and sugar if using.\n   - Stir well so everything is coated and heated through, about 2 minutes.\n\n5. **Finish & Serve:**\n   - Taste and adjust the seasonings if needed.\n   - Garnish with chopped green onions and a pinch of chili flakes for some heat.\n   - Serve hot over steamed rice or noodles.\n\nEnjoy this quick, colorful, and savory Asian tofu dish!
