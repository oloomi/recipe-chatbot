Here's a delicious and satisfying Keto Italian Cauliflower Bake with cheese and bacon that you can whip up in under 30 minutes.\n\n### Italian Cauliflower Cheese & Bacon Casserole\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 1 medium head of cauliflower (about 4 cups florets)\n- 4 slices of bacon\n- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese\n- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n- 1/2 cup heavy cream\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning (or a mix of dried oregano, basil, and thyme)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Fresh parsley (optional) for garnish\n\n#### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Cauliflower:**\n   - Rinse the cauliflower and cut it into bite-sized florets.\n   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add cauliflower florets and cook for about 5 minutes until tender but still firm.\n   - Drain the cauliflower and set aside.\n\n2. **Cook the Bacon:**\n   - While the cauliflower is boiling, dice the bacon into small strips.\n   - In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon until crispy, about 5-7 minutes.\n   - Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess fat.\n   - Leave about 1 tablespoon of bacon fat in the skillet for flavor.\n\n3. **Make the Cream Sauce:**\n   - In the same skillet, add the minced garlic to the bacon fat and saut\u00e9 for about 30 seconds until fragrant.\n   - Pour in the heavy cream, then add Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.\n   - Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 2-3 minutes to let flavors meld.\n\n4. **Combine and Bake:**\n   - Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n   - In a large mixing bowl, toss the drained cauliflower with the cream sauce, most of the cooked bacon (reserve a bit for garnish), and half of the mozzarella cheese.\n   - Transfer this mixture into a baking dish (like a small casserole dish).\n   - Top with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.\n   \n5. **Bake:**\n   - Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.\n\n6. **Serve:**\n   - Garnish with the remaining bacon bits and freshly chopped parsley if desired.\n   - Serve hot, and enjoy this creamy, cheesy, bacon-infused Italian cauliflower delight!\n\nWould you like a different flavor profile or more vegetarian options?"
