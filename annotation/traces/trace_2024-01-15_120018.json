        "content": "One wonderful Mediterranean vegetarian dish you can prepare with basic pantry items is **Mediterranean Chickpea Rice Bowls**. It's flavorful, nutritious, and comes together in about an hour. Here's how to make it:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 1 cup long-grain rice (or any rice you have)\n- 1 can (15 oz) chickpeas, drained and rinsed\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 1 onion, finely chopped\n- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 teaspoon dried oregano\n- 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional but adds depth)\n- 1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes (or 2 fresh tomatoes, chopped)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Lemon wedges (for serving)\n- Optional: chopped fresh herbs like parsley or cilantro\n\n---\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Cook the Rice:**\n   - Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear.\n   - In a medium pot, add 2 cups of water (or broth if available) and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil.\n   - Add the rice, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes or until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed.\n   - Remove from heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.\n\n2. **Prepare the Chickpea Mixture:**\n   - While the rice is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.\n   - Add the chopped onion and saut\u00e9 until translucent, about 5 minutes.\n   - Stir in the minced garlic, oregano, cumin, and paprika. Cook for another minute until fragrant.\n   - Add the drained chickpeas and diced tomatoes. Stir well.\n   - Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n   - Let the mixture simmer for about 15-20 minutes, allowing flavors to meld and the chickpeas to soak up the spices.\n\n3. **Assemble the Bowls:**\n   - Spoon the cooked rice into serving bowls.\n   - Top with the chickpea-tomato mixture.\n   - Squeeze fresh lemon juice over each bowl to brighten the flavors.\n   - Garnish with chopped parsley or cilantro if available.\n\n---\n\nEnjoy your vibrant, Mediterranean-inspired chickpea rice bowls!
