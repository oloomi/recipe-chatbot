Here's a delicious and hearty **Kosher Lemon Herb Chicken with Quinoa and Vegetables**\u2014a flavorful dairy-free meal that\u2019s perfect for any occasion.\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n- 1 cup quinoa\n- 2 cups water or chicken broth\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 lemon (zest and juice)\n- 1 teaspoon dried thyme (or rosemary)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- 1 cup chopped vegetables (such as bell peppers, zucchini, or cherry tomatoes)\n- Fresh parsley or cilantro for garnish (optional)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n#### 1. Prepare the Quinoa:\n- Rinse the quinoa under cold running water using a fine sieve to remove any bitterness.\n- In a medium saucepan, bring 2 cups of water or chicken broth to a boil.\n- Add the rinsed quinoa, a pinch of salt, and reduce the heat to low.\n- Cover and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy.\n- Remove from heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.\n\n#### 2. Marinate the Chicken:\n- While the quinoa cooks, prepare the chicken.\n- In a small bowl, mix the lemon zest, lemon juice, garlic, thyme, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, salt, and pepper.\n- Rub this marinade all over the chicken breasts.\n- Let it sit for at least 10 minutes to absorb the flavors (or longer if you have time).\n\n#### 3. Cook the Chicken:\n- Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.\n- Add the marinated chicken breasts.\n- Cook for about 6-7 minutes on each side, or until the internal temperature reaches 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C), and the chicken is golden brown.\n- Remove from skillet and let rest for a few minutes before slicing.\n\n#### 4. Saut\u00e9 the Vegetables:\n- In the same skillet, add a little more olive oil if needed.\n- Toss in the chopped vegetables.\n- Saut\u00e9 for about 5-7 minutes until tender and slightly caramelized.\n- Season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice for brightness.\n\n#### 5. Assemble the Meal:\n- Slice the rested chicken.\n- Serve the fluffy quinoa on plates, topped with saut\u00e9ed vegetables.\n- Arrange sliced chicken over the quinoa.\n- Garnish with chopped parsley or cilantro if desired.\n\nEnjoy your vibrant, dairy-free kosher meal packed with fresh flavors and wholesome ingredients!
