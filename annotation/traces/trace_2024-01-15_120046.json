        "content": "Absolutely! Here's a simple and flavorful Lemon Garlic Salmon with Asparagus dish that comes together quickly and highlights fresh flavors:\n\n**Lemon Garlic Salmon with Asparagus**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 2 salmon fillets\n- 1 bunch fresh asparagus (about 1 pound)\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 lemon (zest and juice)\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Optional: red pepper flakes for a little heat\n- Fresh parsley or dill for garnish (if available)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Preheat the oven:** Set your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). This allows a quick and even cooking process.\n\n2. **Prepare the asparagus:** Trim the tough ends off the asparagus (about 1-2 inches at the bottom). Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n\n3. **Season the asparagus:** Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil over the asparagus. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and half of the minced garlic. Toss gently to coat evenly.\n\n4. **Prepare the salmon:** Pat the salmon fillets dry with paper towels. Place them on the same baking sheet, leaving space between them. Drizzle the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil over the fillets. Season with salt, pepper, lemon zest, and the remaining garlic. Squeeze half of the lemon juice over the fillets.\n\n5. **Bake:** Place the baking sheet in the oven. Bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the salmon flakes easily with a fork and the asparagus is tender. You can broil for an extra 2 minutes at the end if you want slightly crispy edges.\n\n6. **Finish and serve:** Once done, drizzle the remaining lemon juice over the salmon and asparagus. Garnish with chopped parsley or dill if available. Serve immediately, and enjoy your bright, flavorful dish!\n\nWould you like me to suggest a rice or potato side to complement this?"
