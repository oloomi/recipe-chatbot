It's nut-free, packed with delicious layers, and perfect if you're up for a bit of cooking work. I'll guide you through every step.\n\n### Mexican Chicken Enchilada Casserole\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 1 large onion, finely chopped\n- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 can (15 oz) tomato sauce\n- 1 can (4 oz) diced green chiles\n- 1 teaspoon cumin\n- 1 teaspoon chili powder\n- 1/2 teaspoon paprika\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- 8 small corn or flour tortillas\n- 2 cups shredded cheddar or Mexican blend cheese\n- Fresh cilantro, chopped (optional, for garnish)\n- Sour cream or crema (optional, for serving)\n\n---\n\n### Instructions:\n\n#### Step 1: Cook the Chicken\n1. **Poach the Chicken**: Place the chicken breasts or thighs in a large pot and cover with cold water. Add a pinch of salt.\n2. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until chicken is cooked through (about 15-20 minutes).\n3. Remove the chicken from the water and let it cool slightly. Once cool enough to handle, shred the chicken using two forks or your hands.\n\n#### Step 2: Prepare the Sauce\n1. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.\n2. Add the chopped onion and cook until it becomes translucent, about 5 minutes.\n3. Add the minced garlic, cook for another minute until fragrant.\n4. Stir in the tomato sauce, diced green chiles, cumin, chili powder, paprika, salt, and pepper.\n5. Let the sauce simmer gently for about 10 minutes to meld flavors.\n\n#### Step 3: Combine Chicken and Sauce\n1. Add the shredded chicken into the sauce, stirring well to coat the chicken evenly.\n2. Keep the mixture warm while you prepare the layering.\n\n#### Step 4: Assemble the Enchilada Casserole\n1. Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n2. Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.\n3. Spread a thin layer of the chicken sauce evenly over the bottom.\n4. Place a layer of tortillas over the sauce (cut or overlap as needed).\n5. Spoon a portion of the chicken sauce over the tortillas and sprinkle generously with cheese.\n6. Repeat layering \u2014 tortillas, chicken sauce, cheese \u2014 until all ingredients are used, finishing with a top layer of tortillas covered in sauce and cheese.\n\n#### Step 5: Bake\n1. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.\n2. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.\n3. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes, until the cheese is bubbly and golden.\n\n#### Step 6: Serve\n1. Let the casserole rest for about 5 minutes after baking.\n2. Garnish with chopped cilantro if desired.\n3. Serve hot, topped with sour cream or crema if you like.\n\n---\n\nEnjoy your flavorful, nut-free Mexican Chicken Enchilada Casserole! It's perfect for a hearty dinner and full of spice and comfort. Would you like a vegetarian version or a different Mexican dish?"
