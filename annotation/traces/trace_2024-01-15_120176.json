It\u2019s flavorful, satisfying, and requires only a few ingredients.\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 8 oz spaghetti (or any pasta you have)\n- 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced\n- 1/4 cup olive oil\n- Red pepper flakes (optional, for a bit of heat)\n- Salt to taste\n- Black pepper to taste\n- Fresh or dried parsley (optional, for garnishing)\n- Grated Parmesan cheese (if available)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Cook the pasta:**\n   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.\n   - Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.\n   - Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta.\n\n2. **Prepare the garlic oil:**\n   - While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.\n   - Add the sliced garlic and cook gently, stirring frequently, until it turns golden brown. Be careful not to burn the garlic, as it can become bitter.\n\n3. **Combine:**\n   - Once garlic is fragrant and golden, add a pinch of red pepper flakes (if using).\n   - Add the drained pasta to the skillet. Toss to coat the spaghetti evenly with the garlic oil.\n   - If the mixture seems dry, add a little reserved pasta water to loosen it up and create a glossy sauce.\n\n4. **Season and garnish:**\n   - Season with salt and black pepper to taste.\n   - Toss in chopped parsley if you have it.\n   - Serve hot, with a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese if available.\n\nEnjoy this simple, delicious Italian dinner with pantry staples!
