I recommend trying **Salmon Teriyaki Bowl**\u2014a classic Japanese-inspired dish that's both delicious and easy to prepare within 30 to 60 minutes. \n\n### Ingredients:\n- 2 salmon fillets\n- 2 cups cooked Japanese rice (white or jasmine)\n- 1 tablespoon vegetable or sesame oil\n- 2 tablespoons soy sauce\n- 1 tablespoon mirin (sweet rice wine)\n- 1 tablespoon sake (optional)\n- 1 teaspoon sugar\n- 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger (optional)\n- 1 green onion, sliced (for garnish)\n- Sesame seeds (for topping)\n- Steamed or saut\u00e9ed vegetables (like broccoli, snap peas, or carrots) \u2014 optional but recommended\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Rice:**\n   - Cook your rice according to package instructions. Set aside and keep warm.\n\n2. **Make the Teriyaki Sauce:**\n   - In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, mirin, sake (if using), sugar, and grated ginger.\n   - Mix well until the sugar dissolves. This will be your teriyaki glaze.\n\n3. **Cook the Salmon:**\n   - Pat the salmon fillets dry with paper towels.\n   - Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add the oil.\n   - Once hot, add the salmon fillets skin-side down (if they have skin). Cook for about 4-5 minutes until the skin is crispy and the fish is golden.\n   - Turn the fillets over and cook for another 3-4 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and flaky.\n\n4. **Glaze the Salmon:**\n   - Pour the teriyaki sauce into the skillet with the salmon.\n   - Spoon the sauce over the fillets as they cook, allowing it to thicken slightly to form a glossy glaze. Let it simmer for about 1-2 minutes.\n\n5. **Assemble the Bowl:**\n   - Divide the cooked rice into two bowls.\n   - Place a salmon fillet on top of each rice portion.\n   - Spoon extra teriyaki sauce over the fish and rice.\n   - Garnish with sliced green onions and a sprinkle of sesame seeds.\n   - Add steamed or saut\u00e9ed vegetables on the side or atop the rice for added flavor and nutrition.\n\n### Tips:\n- You can add a soft-boiled or poached egg on top for an extra touch.\n- Use fresh ginger and high-quality soy sauce for the best flavor.\n\nEnjoy your flavorful Salmon Teriyaki Bowl\u2014healthy, satisfying, and truly Japanese! Would you like a vegetarian option or a different type of dish?"
