Prepare the Quinoa (15 minutes):**\n- Rinse the quinoa under cold water using a fine sieve to remove any bitterness.\n- Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add the quinoa along with a pinch of salt.\n- Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the water is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy.\n- Remove from heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.\n\n**2. Cook the Broccoli (5-7 minutes):**\n- While the quinoa cooks, steam or blanch the broccoli florets until bright green and tender, about 4-5 minutes.\n-Drain and set aside.\n\n**3. Prepare the Salmon (15-20 minutes):**\n- Preheat your grill or a grill pan over medium-high heat.\n- In a small bowl, mix soy sauce, honey, grated ginger, minced garlic, rice vinegar, and hoisin or mirin if using.\n- Pat the salmon fillets dry with paper towels. Season lightly with salt and pepper.\n- Brush or marinate the salmon with the sauce mixture (reserve some for drizzling later).\n- Grill the salmon for about 4-5 minutes per side, depending on thickness, until cooked through and grill marks appear. The salmon should flake easily.\n\n**4. Assemble the Bowl:**\n- Divide the cooked quinoa into two bowls.\n- Top each with broccoli florets.\n- Place a grilled salmon fillet on top of each bowl.\n- Drizzle with a bit of the remaining sauce.\n\n**5. Garnish & Serve:**\n- Sprinkle sesame seeds and sliced green onions over the top.\n- Serve each bowl with lemon wedges for squeezing over the salmon.\n\nEnjoy your Japanese-inspired salmon bowl! It\u2019s a perfect balance of flavors and textures with quick, moderate effort."
