It's hearty, flavorful, and uses pantry staples like canned chickpeas, tomatoes, olive oil, and herbs. Here's how to prepare it:\n\n### Ingredients (Pantry Staples)\n- 1 can (15 oz) chickpeas, drained and rinsed\n- 1 can (14.5 oz) diced or crushed tomatoes\n- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 teaspoon dried oregano\n- 1 teaspoon dried thyme or rosemary (optional)\n- Salt and black pepper to taste\n- A pinch of crushed red pepper flakes (optional)\n- Fresh or dried parsley or oregano for garnish (if available)\n\n### Instructions\n1. **Prepare the Base:** In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
