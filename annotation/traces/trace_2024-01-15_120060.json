It's a sophisticated, impressive dish that involves multiple techniques, takes some time, and is free of soy ingredients. The process includes preparing a tender beef fillet, a flavorful mushroom duxelles, and wrapping everything in puff pastry. Here's a detailed step-by-step guide:\n\n---\n\n### **Beef Wellington**\n\n#### **Ingredients (for 4 servings):**\n- 1.5 to 2 lbs (700-900g) beef tenderloin (center-cut)\n- Salt and freshly ground black pepper\n- Olive oil (for searing)\n- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard (check for soy-free) \u2013 optional if you want extra flavor\n- 8 oz (225g) mushrooms (such as cremini or button), finely chopped\n- 2 shallots, finely chopped\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter\n- Fresh thyme sprigs (a few)\n- 8-10 slices of prosciutto or Parma ham\n- Puff pastry sheets (ensure soy-free, usually available in specialty bakeries)\n- 1 egg (beaten, for egg wash)\n- Flour (for dusting)\n\n---\n\n### **Preparation steps:**\n\n#### 1. **Prepare the Beef Tenderloin:**\n- **Trim and Tie:** Trim any excess fat or silver skin from the beef. Tie the tenderloin with kitchen twine to ensure even cooking.\n- **Sear the Beef:** Season generously with salt and pepper. Heat a heavy skillet with olive oil over high heat. When hot, add the beef and sear all sides until a deep brown crust forms \u2014 about 2-3 minutes per side.\n- **Cool and Brush:** Remove from heat, let it cool slightly, then brush all over with a thin layer of Dijon mustard if using (this adds flavor and helps the duxelles stick).\n\n#### 2. **Make the Mushroom Duxelles:**\n- **Cook Aromatics:** Melt butter in a large pan over medium heat. Add shallots and garlic, cooking until softened, about 2 minutes.\n- **Add Mushrooms:** Stir in chopped mushrooms and thyme sprigs. Cook, stirring frequently, until moisture evaporates and the mixture is thick and fragrant \u2014 about 10-15 minutes.\n- **Cool Down:** Remove thyme sprigs, discard, and let the mushroom duxelles cool.\n\n#### 3. **Wrap in Prosciutto:**\n- **Lay Out Prosciutto:** On a sheet of plastic wrap, layer the prosciutto slices slightly overlapping.\n- **Spread Duxelles:** Evenly spread the mushroom duxelles over the prosciutto.\n- **Wrap Beef:** Place the cooled beef in the center, and using the plastic wrap, tightly roll the prosciutto around the beef into a log. Twist the ends of plastic wrap to secure. Chill in the fridge for at least 15-20 minutes.\n\n#### 4. **Prepare Puff Pastry:**\n- On a lightly floured surface, roll out puff pastry into a rectangle large enough to enclose the beef.\n- Unwrap the chilled beef from the plastic wrap and place it in the center of the pastry.\n- Fold the pastry over the beef, trimming excess if necessary. Seal the edges by pressing gently. You can use egg wash to help seal the seams.\n\n#### 5. **Bake:**\n- Preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n- Place the pastry-wrapped beef on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n- Brush the crust with beaten egg for a glossy finish.\n- Cut a few small slits on top to allow steam escape.\n- Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is deep golden brown.\n\n#### 6. **Rest and Serve:**\n- Let the Beef Wellington rest for 10 minutes before slicing.\n- Serve with roasted vegetables or a simple green salad to complete your elegant meal.\n\n---\n\nThis recipe takes time and skill but delivers a truly sophisticated and show-stopping dish.
