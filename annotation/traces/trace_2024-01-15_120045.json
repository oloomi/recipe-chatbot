Here\u2019s how to prepare it:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 2 salmon fillets (about 6 oz each)\n- 1 bunch asparagus (trimmed)\n- 1 lemon (zested and sliced)\n- 3 cloves garlic (minced)\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- Salt and freshly ground black pepper\n- Fresh parsley or dill (optional, for garnish)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Preheat the oven:** \n   Set your oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). This step ensures your salmon and asparagus cook evenly and quickly.\n\n2. **Prepare the asparagus:**\n   - Wash the asparagus and pat dry.\n   - Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n   - Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil over the asparagus.\n   - Season with salt, pepper, and half of the minced garlic.\n   - Toss gently to coat all the spears evenly.\n\n3. **Prepare the salmon:**\n   - Pat the salmon fillets dry with paper towels.\n   - Rub each fillet with 1 teaspoon of olive oil.\n   - Season generously with salt and pepper.\n   - Zest half of the lemon over the fillets for a fresh citrus flavor.\n   - Place the salmon on the same baking sheet beside the asparagus.\n\n4. **Add lemon slices:**\n   - Top each salmon fillet with a few lemon slices.\n   - Scatter the remaining minced garlic and lemon zest over the salmon and asparagus for an extra burst of flavor.\n\n5. **Roast in the oven:**\n   - Bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the salmon flakes easily with a fork and the asparagus is tender.\n   - During the last 2 minutes, you can turn on the broiler for a quick finish to get some lightly charred spots.\n\n6. **Serve:**\n   - Plate the salmon with roasted asparagus.\n   - Squeeze fresh lemon juice over everything for brightness.\n   - Garnish with chopped parsley or dill if desired.\n\n**Tip:** Serve with rice or crusty bread if you want to make it more filling.\n\nEnjoy your bright, flavorful, and healthy lemon garlic salmon with roasted asparagus\u2014ready in just about 30 minutes!"
