        "content": "Absolutely! Here's a delicious and easy low-carb Italian-inspired dish using ground turkey, zucchini, and Parmesan: **Low-Carb Turkey Zucchini Boats**.\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 1 pound ground turkey\n- 2 medium zucchinis\n- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 small onion, finely chopped\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Optional: crushed red pepper flakes, fresh basil or parsley for garnish\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Preheat the oven:** to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n\n2. **Prepare the zucchinis:** Wash the zucchinis thoroughly. Slice the zucchinis in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, carefully scoop out the inner flesh, leaving about 1/4 inch border to create \"boats.\" Dice the scooped-out zucchini flesh and set aside.\n\n3. **Saut\u00e9 the filling:** In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 2-3 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds until fragrant.\n\n4. **Cook the turkey:** Add the ground turkey to the skillet, breaking it apart with a spatula. Cook until browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and optional red pepper flakes for some heat.\n\n5. **Add the zucchini flesh:** Stir in the diced zucchini flesh and cook for another 3-4 minutes until tender. Remove from heat and stir in half of the Parmesan cheese.\n\n6. **Stuff the zucchini boats:** Place the zucchini halves on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a greased baking dish. Fill each zucchini boat with the turkey mixture, packing it in gently.\n\n7. **Add cheese and bake:** Sprinkle the remaining Parmesan cheese on top of each stuffed zucchini. Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, until the zucchinis are tender and the cheese is golden.\n\n8. **Serve:** Garnish with chopped fresh basil or parsley if desired, and enjoy your hearty low-carb Italian turkey zucchini boats!\n\nWould you like me to suggest a side dish or another variation?"
