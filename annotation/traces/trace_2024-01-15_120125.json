I recommend trying your hand at making **Lasagna alla Bolognese with Bechamel and Parmigiano** \u2014 a luxurious, multi-layered Italian classic that will truly impress. This dish combines a slow-simmered meat rag\u00f9, creamy b\u00e9chamel sauce, and perfectly layered pasta, creating rich, deep flavors with complex textures. Here\u2019s a detailed step-by-step guide:\n\n---\n\n### **Lasagna alla Bolognese with B\u00e9chamel and Parmigiano**\n\n#### **Ingredients:** (for about 8 servings)\n\n**For the Bolognese sauce:**\n- 2 tbsp olive oil\n- 1 large onion, finely chopped\n- 2 carrots, finely chopped\n- 2 celery stalks, finely chopped\n- 4 oz Pancetta or bacon, finely chopped (optional, but adds depth)\n- 1 lb ground beef (or half beef, half pork)\n- 1 cup dry red wine\n- 28 oz (800g) canned crushed tomatoes\n- 2 tbsp tomato paste\n- 1 tsp dried oregano\n- 1 tsp dried thyme\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Bay leaf (optional)\n- Milk or water (if needed, to shorten cooking time)\n\n**For the B\u00e9chamel sauce:**\n- 4 tbsp unsalted butter\n- 4 tbsp all-purpose flour\n- 4 cups whole milk\n- Nutmeg, a pinch\n- Salt and white pepper to taste\n\n**Other:**\n- 12 lasagna sheets (preferably fresh or no-boil type)\n- 1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano\n- Olive oil for drizzling\n\n---\n\n### **Steps:**\n\n#### **1. Prepare the Bolognese Sauce**\n1. **Saut\u00e9 the base:** Heat olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add chopped onion, carrots, and celery. Cook until softened, about 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n2. **Add pancetta:** If using, add chopped pancetta and cook until browned and fragrant.\n3. **Brown the meat:** Increase heat to medium-high. Add ground beef, breaking it apart with a spoon. Cook until browned all over, around 10 minutes.\n4. **Pour in wine:** Deglaze the pan with red wine, scraping up any browned bits. Let it simmer until the wine reduces by half.\n5. **Add tomatoes and seasonings:** Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, thyme, bay leaf, salt, and pepper.\n6. **Simmer slowly:** Lower the heat and cook uncovered for at least 1.5 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally. You can add a splash of milk or water if the sauce thickens too much or starts sticking.\n\n#### **2. Make the B\u00e9chamel Sauce**\n1. **Create roux:** In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add flour and whisk continuously for 1-2 minutes until lightly golden.\n2. **Add milk gradually:** Pour in milk in small increments, whisking constantly to prevent lumps.\n3. **Cook until thickened:** Continue whisking until the sauce coats the back of a spoon (about 8-10 minutes). Season with salt, a pinch of nutmeg, and white pepper.\n4. **Adjust thickness:** If too thick, add a bit more milk; if too thin, cook a little longer.\n\n#### **3. Assemble the Lasagna**\n1. **Preheat oven:** to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n2. **Layering:** Use a deep baking dish.\n   - Spread a thin layer of Bolognese on the bottom.\n   - Place lasagna sheets over the sauce.\n   - Spread a layer of Bolognese sauce, then some b\u00e9chamel.\n   - Sprinkle with Parmigiano.\n   - Repeat layers (meat, pasta, b\u00e9chamel, cheese) until all ingredients are used, finishing with a top layer of b\u00e9chamel and Parmigiano.\n\n#### **4. Bake**\n1. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.\n2. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.\n3. Remove foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes, until bubbling and golden on top.\n4. Let sit for 15 minutes before slicing \u2014 this helps set the layers.\n\n---\n\n### **Serving suggestion:**  \nServe hot with a simple arugula salad dressed with olive oil and lemon to balance the richness.\n\n---\n\nThis lasagna involves some patience but results in an intensely flavorful, layered masterpiece that will truly impress your guests. Would you like a wine pairing or some tips on making it ahead?"
