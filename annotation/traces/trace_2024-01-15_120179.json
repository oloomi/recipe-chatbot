It\u2019s perfect if you have basic pantry ingredients like spaghetti, garlic, olive oil, and red pepper flakes.\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 8 oz (about half a box) of spaghetti\n- 4 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced\n- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil\n- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to your spice preference)\n- Salt to taste\n- Freshly ground black pepper (optional)\n- Fresh parsley (if available, for garnish)\n- Grated kosher Parmesan cheese (optional, check if kosher)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Cook the Pasta:**\n   - Fill a large pot with water and add a generous pinch of salt.\n   - Bring the water to a boil over high heat.\n   - Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente (just tender but still firm).\n   - Once cooked, reserve about 1/2 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta and set aside.\n\n2. **Prepare the Garlic and Oil:**\n   - While pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.\n   - Add the thinly sliced garlic to the oil.\n   - Saut\u00e9 gently, stirring often, until the garlic turns golden brown and fragrant\u2014about 2-3 minutes. Be careful not to burn the garlic, as it can become bitter.\n\n3. **Combine Pasta and Flavored Oil:**\n   - Add the drained pasta to the skillet with the garlic and oil.\n   - Toss to coat the pasta evenly, adding a splash of reserved pasta water if the mixture seems dry.\n   - Stir in the red pepper flakes and season with salt and black pepper to taste.\n\n4. **Finish and Serve:**\n   - If you have fresh parsley, chop a small handful and sprinkle on top for color and flavor.\n   - Optionally, add some grated kosher Parmesan cheese.\n   - Serve immediately while warm.\n\n**Tip:** This dish pairs beautifully with a simple green salad or crusty bread.\n\nEnjoy your delicious, easy Italian pasta!
