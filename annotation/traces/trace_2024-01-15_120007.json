        "content": "Absolutely! Here's a quick and delicious Pesto Salmon Fillet that you can whip up in about 20 minutes.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 2 salmon fillets\n- Salt and freshly ground black pepper\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 1/4 cup basil pesto (store-bought or homemade)\n- Lemon wedges (for serving)\n- Optional: cherry tomatoes or steamed vegetables for sides\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Preheat your oven:** Set it to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C). If you prefer, you can also cook the salmon on the stovetop, but baking is quick and easy.\n\n2. **Prepare the baking dish:** Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it with a teaspoon of olive oil to prevent sticking.\n\n3. **Season the salmon:** Pat the fillets dry with paper towels. Season both sides generously with salt and pepper.\n\n4. **Sear the salmon (optional but recommended):** Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Place the salmon fillets skin-side down. Sear for about 2-3 minutes until the skin is crispy. Flip the fillets carefully and sear for another 1 minute.\n\n   *If you prefer, you can skip searing and proceed directly to baking.*\n\n5. **Apply the pesto:** Remove the skillet from heat if searing. Spread about 1-2 tablespoons of basil pesto evenly over the top of each salmon fillet.\n\n6. **Bake:** Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven if searing, or place the prepared fillets on the baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the salmon flakes easily with a fork.\n\n7. **Serve:** Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the salmon before serving. Pair with steamed vegetables or a light salad for a complete meal.\n\n**Tip:** This dish pairs beautifully with a quick side of quinoa or rice if you want extras.\n\nEnjoy your flavorful and healthy salmon in no time!
