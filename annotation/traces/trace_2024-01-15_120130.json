        "content": "Absolutely! How about trying a flavorful Coconut Curry Chicken with Spinach? It's a delicious, dairy-free dish with rich Caribbean or Southeast Asian-inspired flavors. Here's a detailed recipe to guide you:\n\n**Coconut Curry Chicken with Spinach**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (or thighs), cut into bite-sized pieces\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil or coconut oil\n- 1 onion, finely chopped\n- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1-inch piece fresh ginger, grated\n- 1 can (13.5 oz) coconut milk\n- 2 tablespoons curry powder (adjust to taste)\n- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder (optional)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- 3 cups fresh spinach, roughly chopped\n- Juice of 1 lime (optional for brightness)\n- Fresh cilantro, chopped (optional for garnish)\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Chicken:**  \n   Start by heating a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of oil and let it warm up. Once hot, add the chicken pieces in an even layer. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they are browned and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.\n\n2. **Saut\u00e9 Aromatics:**  \n   In the same skillet, add a bit more oil if needed. Toss in the chopped onion and saut\u00e9 for 3-4 minutes until translucent and fragrant. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for another minute until aromatic.\n\n3. **Add Spices:**  \n   Stir in the curry powder and turmeric (if using). Cook for about 30 seconds to toast the spices slightly, enhancing their flavor.\n\n4. **Pour in Coconut Milk:**  \n   Gradually add the coconut milk, scraping any browned bits off the bottom of the pan for extra flavor. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer.\n\n5. **Simmer the Chicken:**  \n   Return the cooked chicken to the skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low and let everything simmer for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken slightly.\n\n6. **Add Spinach:**  \n   Stir in the chopped spinach and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until wilted. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\n7. **Finish with Lime and Garnish:**  \n   Squeeze fresh lime juice over the dish for a bright contrast (optional). Garnish with chopped cilantro if desired.\n\n8. **Serve:**  \n   Serve hot over steamed rice, cauliflower rice, or even noodles for a hearty, dairy-free meal.\n\nEnjoy your warm, comforting Coconut Curry Chicken with Spinach!
