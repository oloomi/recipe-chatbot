It's naturally gluten-free and offers a delightful culinary experience. Here's a detailed recipe that takes approximately 45-60 minutes to prepare:\n\n---\n\n### Chicken Chettinad (Gluten-Free Indian Spicy Chicken Curry)\n\n#### Ingredients:\n**For the marinade:**\n- 1 lb (450g) chicken thighs or drumsticks, bone-in or boneless, cut into pieces\n- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder\n- Salt to taste\n\n**For the spice paste:**\n- 2 tablespoons coriander seeds\n- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds\n- 1 teaspoon black peppercorns\n- 4-5 dried red chilies (adjust to spice preference)\n- 1 small onion, sliced\n- 4 cloves garlic\n- 1-inch piece fresh ginger, chopped\n- 1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (optional)\n- 2 tablespoons grated fresh coconut or desiccated coconut (optional for extra richness)\n- 2 tablespoons water (for grinding)\n\n**Others:**\n- 2 tablespoons oil (vegetable or coconut oil)\n- 1 large onion, finely sliced\n- 2 tomatoes, chopped\n- 1 teaspoon fennel seeds\n- 1 cinnamon stick\n- 2-3 green cardamom pods\n- 2 bay leaves\n- Salt to taste\n- Fresh coriander leaves for garnish\n\n#### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the spice paste:**\n   - In a dry skillet over medium heat, toast coriander seeds, cumin seeds, black peppercorns, dried red chilies, fennel seeds, cinnamon, cardamom, and fenugreek seeds until fragrant (about 2-3 minutes).\n   - Allow the toasted spices to cool slightly, then transfer them to a blender or spice grinder.\n   - Add sliced onion, garlic, ginger, grated coconut (if using), and 2 tablespoons water.\n   - Blend into a smooth, thick paste. Add a little more water if necessary, but keep the paste thick.\n\n2. **Marinate the chicken:**\n   - In a bowl, toss the chicken pieces with turmeric and a pinch of salt.\n   - Set aside for about 10-15 minutes to absorb some spices.\n\n3. **Cook the curry:**\n   - Heat oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or deep skillet over medium heat.\n   - Add bay leaves, green cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Saut\u00e9 for about 30 seconds until fragrant.\n   - Add the sliced onions and cook until golden brown, about 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n   - Add the prepared spice paste and cook, stirring frequently, for about 8-10 minutes until the oil begins to separate and the flavors meld.\n   - Add chopped tomatoes and cook for another 5 minutes until they soften.\n   \n4. **Add the chicken:**\n   - Stir in the marinated chicken pieces.\n   - Cook for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and coated with the spice mixture. If the curry gets too thick, add a splash of warm water.\n   \n5. **Final seasoning:**\n   - Taste and adjust salt as needed.\n   - Simmer gently for another 5 minutes to let the flavors deepen.\n\n6. **Garnish and serve:**\n   - Garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves.\n   - Serve hot with steamed rice or gluten-free South Indian millet or rice-based bread like dosa or appam.\n\n---\n\nEnjoy your homemade, gluten-free Chicken Chettinad\u2014a complex, spicy dish that\u2019s perfect for a high-effort cooking experience!
