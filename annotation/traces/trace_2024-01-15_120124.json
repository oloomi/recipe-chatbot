If including protein, cook and set aside.\n\n3. **Cook the Eggs:**  \n   Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.  \n   Beat the eggs and pour into the skillet. Scramble until just cooked, then remove and set aside.\n\n4. **Saut\u00e9 Aromatics & Vegetables:**  \n   Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil to the skillet.  \n   Add the chopped onion and minced garlic; saut\u00e9 for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.  \n   Toss in your mixed vegetables; cook for about 3-4 minutes until tender.\n\n5. **Add the Cauliflower Rice:**  \n   Push vegetables to one side of the skillet. Add the cauliflower rice to the empty side. Cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring frequently, until the cauliflower is tender and slightly browned.\n\n6. **Combine & Season:**  \n   Mix all ingredients together. Add soy sauce or coconut aminos and sesame oil. Stir well to evenly coat everything. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\n7. **Finish with Eggs & Protein:**  \n   Return the scrambled eggs to the skillet, breaking them apart and mixing well. If using cooked meat or tofu, toss it in now to warm through.\n\n8. **Serve:**  \n   Garnish with chopped green onions if desired. Serve hot!\n\nThis dish is quick to make, filling, and wonderfully customizable. Would you like a recipe with a specific protein or other dietary preferences?"
