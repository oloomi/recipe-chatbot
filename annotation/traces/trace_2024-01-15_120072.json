        "content": "Certainly! I recommend trying **Chicken Chettinad (Chettinad Chicken Curry)**, a flavorful and spicy South Indian dish. It's naturally gluten-free, rich in aromatic spices, and can be prepared in about 45 minutes with a bit of focus. Let\u2019s get started!\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 500g chicken pieces (preferably bone-in for more flavor)\n- 2 tbsp oil (vegetable or coconut oil)\n- 1 large onion, finely chopped\n- 2 tomatoes, pureed or finely chopped\n- 2 tsp ginger-garlic paste\n- 1 tsp turmeric powder\n- 2 tsp red chili powder (adjust to taste)\n- 1 tbsp coriander powder\n- 1 tsp cumin seeds\n- 1 tsp fennel seeds\n- 2-3 dried red chilies (soaked in warm water for 10 mins)\n- 1 tsp black peppercorns\n- 1 cinnamon stick\n- 2-3 cloves\n- 1-2 bay leaves\n- 2 tbsp grated coconut (fresh or dried)\n- Salt to taste\n- Fresh coriander leaves for garnish\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Spice Paste:**\n   - Drain the soaked dried red chilies and blend them with fennel seeds, black peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, grated coconut, and a little water into a smooth paste. This will be your Chettinad masala base.\n\n2. **Cooking the Chicken:**\n   - Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.\n   - Add cumin seeds, bay leaves, and cinnamon stick. Let them sizzle for about 30 seconds.\n   - Add chopped onions and saut\u00e9 until golden brown, about 5-7 minutes.\n   - Stir in the ginger-garlic paste and cook for another 2 minutes until fragrant.\n   \n3. **Add Tomato and Spices:**\n   - Mix in the pureed or chopped tomatoes and cook until the oil starts to separate from the masala, about 5-7 minutes.\n   - Add turmeric, red chili powder, and coriander powder. Cook for a minute to toast the spices.\n\n4. **Add the Masala Paste:**\n   - Incorporate the prepared spice paste into the onion-tomato mixture.\n   - Cook, stirring occasionally, until the paste darkens and aroma develops, about 8-10 minutes.\n\n5. **Cook the Chicken:**\n   - Add chicken pieces to the pot, stirring well to coat with the masala.\n   - Cover and cook on medium heat for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is tender and cooked through.\n   - Check seasoning and add salt accordingly.\n\n6. **Finish and Garnish:**\n   - If the curry is too thick, add a splash of water and simmer for a few more minutes.\n   - Garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves.\n\n### Serving:\nServe hot with steamed rice or gluten-free millet rotis. This dish is spicy, aromatic, and perfect for an advanced gluten-free Indian meal.\n\nWould you like a side dish or a dessert to complement this?"
