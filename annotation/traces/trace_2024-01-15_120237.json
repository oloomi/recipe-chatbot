Here's how to make it:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 12 oz (340 g) of your favorite pasta (penne, fusilli, or spaghetti)\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes or tomato puree\n- 1 teaspoon dried oregano\n- 1 teaspoon dried basil or fresh basil if available\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- 2 cups fresh spinach leaves\n- 1/2 cup heavy cream or plant-based alternative (like coconut cream)\n- Grated Parmesan or vegetarian cheese (optional)\n- Red pepper flakes (optional for a bit of heat)\n\n### Instructions:\n1. **Cook the Pasta:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente (usually about 8-10 minutes). Drain and set aside.\n\n2. **Prepare the Sauce:** While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saut\u00e9 for about 1 minute until fragrant, being careful not to burn it.\n\n3. **Add Tomatoes:** Pour in the crushed tomatoes, stirring well. Add dried oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Let the sauce simmer gently for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, to develop flavor.\n\n4. **Add Spinach and Cream:** Stir in the fresh spinach leaves and cook until wilted, about 2-3 minutes. Then, pour in the heavy cream, stirring until the sauce is creamy and heated through. Adjust seasoning if needed.\n\n5. **Combine with Pasta:** Add the cooked pasta into the skillet with the sauce. Toss everything together so the pasta is evenly coated.\n\n6. **Serve:** Divide into bowls, top with grated Parmesan if desired, and sprinkle red pepper flakes for a touch of heat. Enjoy your warm, creamy vegetarian pasta!\n\nThis dish pairs nicely with a simple salad and crusty bread. Would you like suggestions for side dishes or dessert?"
