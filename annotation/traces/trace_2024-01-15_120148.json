Plus, it\u2019s halal and made with pantry staples you likely have or can easily find.\n\n### Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani\n\n#### Ingredients:\n**For the marinade:**\n- 500g (about 1 lb) chicken pieces (preferably with bones, like thighs or drumsticks)\n- 1 cup plain yogurt\n- 2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste\n- 1 tsp turmeric powder\n- 1 tsp red chili powder\n- 1 tsp cumin powder\n- 1 tsp coriander powder\n- Salt to taste\n- Juice of half a lemon (optional)\n\n**For the rice:**\n- 2 cups basmati rice (or long-grain rice)\n- 4 cups water\n- 2-3 bay leaves\n- 4-5 whole cloves\n- 2-3 green cardamom pods\n- 1-2 cinnamon sticks\n- 1 tsp salt\n\n**For the layers and garnishing:**\n- 1 large onion, thinly sliced\n- 2 tbsp oil or ghee\n- A handful of fresh coriander leaves, chopped\n- A handful of fresh mint leaves, chopped\n- A pinch of saffron strands soaked in 2 tbsp warm milk (optional)\n- Fried onions (optional, for garnish)\n\n---\n\n### Instructions:\n\n#### Step 1: Marinate the chicken\n1. In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chili, cumin, coriander, salt, and lemon juice.\n2. Add the chicken pieces and coat them thoroughly with the marinade.\n3. Cover and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight for maximum flavor.\n\n#### Step 2: Prepare the rice\n1. Rinse the rice thoroughly under cold water until the water runs clear to remove excess starch.\n2. In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil.\n3. Add bay leaves, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, and salt.\n4. Add the rinsed rice and cook until it's about 70% done (it should still have a slight bite). Drain and set aside.\n\n#### Step 3: Cook the chicken\n1. In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat 2 tbsp oil or ghee over medium heat.\n2. Add sliced onions and cook until golden brown and caramelized\u2014this may take about 10-15 minutes.\n3. Add the marinated chicken and cook on high heat for about 5-7 minutes to seal the juices.\n4. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until the chicken is cooked through and tender, about 20-25 minutes. Stir occasionally.\n\n#### Step 4: Layer the biryani\n1. Once the chicken is cooked, remove half of it and set aside.\n2. Spread a layer of partially cooked rice over the chicken remaining in the pot.\n3. If using saffron, drizzle the saffron milk over the rice layer.\n4. Add the remaining chicken on top of the rice.\n5. Cover the pot tightly with a lid or aluminum foil to trap steam.\n6. Place a clean kitchen towel or cloth over the lid to prevent condensation from dripping back onto the rice (this helps in even cooking).\n\n#### Step 5: Dum cooking (steam baking)\n1. On very low heat, cook the layered biryani for about 20-25 minutes.\n2. Alternatively, you can also place the entire pot on a griddle or tawa (flat skillet) over low heat to prevent direct contact and avoid burning.\n\n#### Step 6: Serve\n1. Turn off the heat and let the biryani rest for 5 minutes.\n2. Gently fluff the rice with a fork, mixing the layers slightly.\n3. Garnish with chopped coriander, mint, and fried onions if available.\n4. Serve hot with a side of raita (yogurt sauce) or salad.\n\n---\n\nEnjoy this rich and aromatic Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani \u2014 a true celebration of Indian flavors!
