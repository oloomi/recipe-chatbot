Here's a flavorful, low-carb recipe for **Eggplant and Ground Turkey Stir-Fry** that you can prepare in under 30 minutes.\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 1 large eggplant (about 1 pound), cut into bite-sized cubes\n- 1 pound ground turkey\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\n- 1 tablespoon soy sauce or tamari (for gluten-free)\n- 1 teaspoon sesame oil (optional, for added flavor)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Optional garnish: chopped green onions or sesame seeds\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prep the Eggplant:**\n   - Start by washing your eggplant thoroughly.\n   - Cut off the stem and grower ends, then cube the eggplant into bite-sized pieces. Set aside.\n\n2. **Cook the Eggplant:**\n   - Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.\n   - Once hot, add the cubed eggplant.\n   - Stir frequently and cook for about 8-10 minutes, until the eggplant is tender and slightly browned.\n   - If the eggplant absorbs too much oil and starts sticking, add a splash of water to help steam it and free up the stuck bits. This also helps in cooking it faster.\n\n3. **Add Ground Turkey:**\n   - Push the eggplant to one side of the skillet.\n   - Add the ground turkey to the cleared side.\n   - Break it apart with a spatula and cook for about 5-7 minutes until browned and cooked through.\n   - Stir everything together so the flavors meld.\n\n4. **Add Flavors:**\n   - Add the minced garlic and cook for about 30 seconds until fragrant.\n   - Pour in the soy sauce and stir well to coat evenly.\n   - Drizzle the sesame oil if using, and season with salt and pepper to taste.\n   - Cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing flavors to combine.\n\n5. **Serve:**\n   - Transfer your stir-fry to a plate.\n   - Garnish with chopped green onions or sesame seeds if desired.\n   - Serve hot\u2014enjoy your quick, low-carb eggplant and ground turkey dish!\n\nWould you like a vegetarian or a spicier version next?"
