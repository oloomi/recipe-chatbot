It\u2019s nutritious, flavorful, and perfect for a quick lunch or dinner.\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 1 cup dried or 1 can (15 oz) chickpeas (drained and rinsed if canned)\n- 1 cup quinoa\n- 2 cups water or vegetable broth (for cooking quinoa)\n- 1 medium cucumber, diced\n- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved\n- 1/4 cup red onion, finely chopped\n- 1/4 cup fresh parsley or cilantro, chopped\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- Juice of 1 lemon\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Optional: 1 avocado, diced or 1/4 cup sliced olives\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Cook the Quinoa:**\n   - Rinse the quinoa thoroughly under cold water using a fine mesh sieve. This removes any bitterness.\n   - In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and water or vegetable broth.\n   - Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the quinoa has absorbed all the liquid and is fluffy.\n   - Remove from heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes to steam. Fluff with a fork and set aside to cool slightly.\n\n2. **Prepare the Chickpeas:**\n   - If using canned chickpeas, drain and rinse them well under cold water. If using dried chickpeas, cook them in boiling water until tender (about 1 hour), then drain.\n   - For added flavor, you can toss the chickpeas with a pinch of salt, pepper, and a dash of olive oil and roast them in a preheated oven at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for 15-20 minutes until slightly crispy, but this step is optional.\n\n3. **Assemble the Salad:**\n   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked quinoa and chickpeas.\n   - Add the diced cucumber, cherry tomatoes, red onion, and chopped herbs.\n   - Drizzle with olive oil and lemon juice. Toss gently to combine.\n   - Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\n4. **Serve:**\n   - Garnish with extra herbs or sliced avocado if desired.\n   - This salad can be served immediately or chilled in the fridge for an hour for more flavor.\n\nEnjoy this fresh, protein-packed vegan chickpea and quinoa salad\u2014perfect for a quick healthy meal!
