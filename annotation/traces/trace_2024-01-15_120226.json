It\u2019s a delicious, complex dish that's perfect for a satisfying meal around 45 minutes.\n\n---\n\n### Machboos (Kuwaiti Spiced Rice with Meat)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 1 lb (450g) chicken pieces (drumsticks, thighs, or breast)\n- 2 cups long-grain basmati rice\n- 1 large onion, finely chopped\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 medium tomato, chopped\n- 2 tablespoons tomato paste\n- 2 teaspoons ground cumin\n- 1 teaspoon ground coriander\n- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder\n- 1 teaspoon cinnamon powder\n- 2 bay leaves\n- 4 whole cardamom pods\n- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper\n- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves (optional)\n- 4 cups chicken broth or water\n- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n- Salt to taste\n- Fresh cilantro or parsley for garnish\n- Sliced almonds or fried onions for garnish (optional)\n\n---\n\n### Instructions:\n\n**1. Prepare the Meat:**\n- Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat.\n- Add the chicken pieces, season lightly with salt, and brown them on all sides for about 5-7 minutes. Remove and set aside.\n\n**2. Saut\u00e9 the Aromatics:**\n- In the same pot, add the chopped onion and cook until soft and golden, about 5 minutes.\n- Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n\n**3. Build the Spice Base:**\n- Stir in the chopped tomato and tomato paste. Cook for 3-4 minutes until the mixture thickens slightly.\n- Add the cumin, coriander, turmeric, cinnamon, bay leaves, cardamom, black pepper, and cloves. Stir well to coat everything in the spices.\n\n**4. Add the Meat and Rice:**\n- Return the browned chicken to the pot. Mix to incorporate the spices.\n- Rinse the rice under cold water until clear, then drain.\n- Add the rice to the pot, stirring gently to combine with the meat and spices.\n\n**5. Add Liquid and Cook:**\n- Pour in the chicken broth or water. The liquid should just cover the rice and meat; add more if needed.\n- Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.\n- Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot tightly, and simmer for about 25-30 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed.\n\n**6. Rest and Garnish:**\n- Turn off the heat and gently fluff the rice with a fork.\n- Let it rest, covered, for about 5 minutes.\n- Garnish with chopped cilantro or parsley, and sprinkle sliced almonds or fried onions if desired.\n\n---\n\n### Serving:\nServe hot with a side of yogurt or a fresh salad. Machboos is a fragrant, comforting dish packed with Middle Eastern spices, perfect for a complex yet manageable meal in around 45 minutes.\n\nWould you like a vegetarian version or a different protein?"
