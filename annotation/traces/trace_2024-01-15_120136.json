It's a bit complex but well worth the effort, and it can be prepared in about 45 minutes if you use canned lentils and Prepared ingredients smartly.

If using a regular pot, simmer for about 30-40 minutes until soft, adding more water if necessary.\n    - Once cooked, mash a few of the lentils with the back of a spoon for creaminess, but leave some whole.\n\n2. **Prepare the Masala:**\n    - In a large pan, heat the ghee or oil over medium heat.\n    - Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle for about 30 seconds.\n    - Add the chopped onions and saut\u00e9 until golden brown, about 8-10 minutes.\n    - Stir in the ginger-garlic paste and chopped green chilies; cook for another 2 minutes until fragrant.\n    - Add the tomato puree, turmeric, coriander powder, red chili powder, and salt.\n    - Cook this mixture until the oil begins to separate from the masala, about 8-10 minutes. Stir occasionally.\n\n3. **Combine and Simmer:**\n    - Add the cooked lentils to the masala pot. Mix well.\n    - Adjust the consistency by adding a little water if too thick; simmer uncovered for about 15 minutes to meld flavors and develop richness.\n    - Stir in garam masala and dried fenugreek leaves (if using). Let it simmer for an additional 5 minutes.\n\n4. **Finish with Cream:**\n    - Reduce heat to low and stir in the heavy cream or milk.\n    - Simmer for another 5 minutes, but do not boil rapidly to keep the cream from curdling.\n\n5. **Serve:**\n    - Garnish with chopped fresh coriander leaves.\n    - Serve hot with steamed basmati rice or naan bread.\n\n---\n\nThis dish offers a beautiful balance of spices and a luscious texture, making it a classic for special occasions or weekend indulgence.
