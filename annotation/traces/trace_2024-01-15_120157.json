Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you craft this delicious dish:\n\n### Chicken Enchiladas with Green Chile Sauce\n\n---\n\n#### Ingredients:\n\n**For the Chicken Filling:**\n- 2 cups cooked chicken, shredded (rotisserie or boiled chicken works well)\n- 1 small onion, finely chopped\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 teaspoon cumin\n- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\n\n**For the Green Chile Sauce:**\n- 4 large green chilies (Jalape\u00f1o or Hatch chilies), roasted, peeled, and chopped\n- 1 cup chicken broth\n- 1 small onion, chopped\n- 2 cloves garlic\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\n- 1 teaspoon cumin\n- 1/2 teaspoon oregano\n- 1 tablespoon flour (for thickening)\n- Salt to taste\n\n**For Assembling:**\n- 8-10 corn tortillas\n- 1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar, Monterey Jack, or a Mexican blend)\n- Fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)\n- Sour cream or Mexican crema (optional, for serving)\n\n---\n\n### Instructions:\n\n#### 1. Prepare the Chicken Filling:\n- Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.\n- Add the chopped onion and saut\u00e9 until translucent, about 3-4 minutes.\n- Add garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n- Stir in the shredded chicken, cumin, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper.\n- Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently, to let the flavors combine.\n- Remove from heat and set aside.\n\n#### 2. Roast and Prepare the Green Chile Sauce:\n- Preheat your oven's broiler or use a gas flame.\n- Carefully roast the green chilies on a baking sheet or directly over a gas flame until the skin is charred and blistered, about 5 minutes.\n- Place roasted chilies in a bowl, cover with foil or plastic wrap, and let steam for 10 minutes. Then peel off the charred skin, stem, and seed the chilies.\n- In a blender, combine roasted chilies, chopped onion, garlic, chicken broth, cumin, oregano, and a pinch of salt. Blend until smooth.\n- Pour the mixture into a saucepan over medium heat.\n- In a small bowl, mix the flour with a little water to create a slurry and whisk it into the sauce to thicken.\n- Simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Adjust seasoning as needed.\n\n#### 3. Assemble the Enchiladas:\n- Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n- Lightly grease a baking dish.\n- Warm the corn tortillas in a dry skillet for a few seconds on each side or cover them with a damp towel and microwave for 30 seconds to make them pliable.\n- Spoon a portion of the chicken filling into each tortilla, roll it up tightly, and place seam-side down in the baking dish.\n- Once all tortillas are filled and arranged in the dish, pour the green chile sauce evenly over the top.\n- Sprinkle shredded cheese evenly over the sauce.\n\n#### 4. Bake:\n- Cover the dish loosely with foil.\n- Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbly.\n- Remove the foil and bake for an additional 5 minutes to crisp the cheese slightly if desired.\n\n#### 5. Serve:\n- Garnish with chopped cilantro if desired.\n- Serve hot, with optional sides of sour cream, chopped onions, or fresh lime wedges.\n\n---\n\nEnjoy your flavorful, nut-free Mexican chicken enchiladas!
