Let me introduce you to **Miso Glass Noodle Soup (Soumen Miso)** \u2014 a comforting, flavorful, and relatively low-sodium Japanese dish that\u2019s ideal if you want something both tasty and wholesome. This recipe uses kombu (seaweed) and miso for rich umami without excessive salt, and the glass noodles are light yet satisfying.\n\n---\n\n### **Miso Glass Noodle Soup (Soumen Miso)**\n\n#### **Ingredients** (serves 4)\n- **4 cups water**\n- **1 piece of dried kombu (about 4 inches)**\n- **2 tablespoons white miso paste** (preferably low-sodium if available)\n- **100g (about 3.5 oz) glass noodles (somen or mung bean starch noodles)**\n- **1 small carrot, julienned**\n- **1/2 cup spinach, roughly chopped**\n- **1/2 cup sliced shiitake mushrooms (fresh or rehydrated)**\n- **2 green onions, sliced thinly (for garnish)**\n- **Optional:** thin slices of cooked chicken breast or tofu for added protein\n\n---\n\n### **Preparation Steps**\n\n1. **Prepare the Dashi Broth:**\n   - Gently wipe the kombu with a damp cloth to remove any surface impurities, but avoid rinsing off the white powder known as *the umami* \u2013 it\u2019s key to flavor.\n   - In a pot, add 4 cups of cold water and the kombu.\n   - Place over medium-low heat, slowly bringing to just before boiling (look for small bubbles at the edges). Do not let it boil vigorously, as this can release a bitter taste.\n   - Once near boiling, remove and discard the kombu. Let the broth sit for a few minutes to deepen the flavor.\n\n2. **Cook the Glass Noodles:**\n   - Meanwhile, soak the glass noodles in hot water for about 10 minutes, or until soft. Drain thoroughly and set aside.\n\n3. **Divide the Soup:**\n   - Return the broth to a gentle simmer.\n   - Add the sliced carrots and shiitake mushrooms. Cook for about 2-3 minutes until slightly tender.\n   - Add the spinach and cook for another minute until just wilted.\n\n4. **Finish with Miso:**\n   - Take a small ladle of hot broth and put it into a bowl.\n   - Add the miso paste to this bowl and whisk until smooth.\n   - Slowly pour the miso mixture back into the pot, stirring gently, ensuring the broth doesn't boil vigorously again, as high heat can degrade the miso's flavor and nutrients.\n   - Taste the broth; if it\u2019s too mild, you can add a tiny bit more miso, but be cautious to maintain the low-sodium profile.\n\n5. **Add the Noodles:**\n   - Divide the drained glass noodles among four bowls.\n   - Ladle the hot miso broth with vegetables into each bowl over the noodles.\n\n6. **Garnish and Serve:**\n   - Garnish with thinly sliced green onions.\n   - For extra protein, add slices of cooked chicken or tofu if desired.\n\n---\n\n### **Tips**\n- Adjust the miso quantity for preferred flavor; start with 2 tablespoons and add more if needed.\n- Use low-sodium miso if available, or dilute regular miso with a bit of water for milder flavor.\n- This soup can be customized with seasonal vegetables or seaweed.\n\n---\n\nEnjoy your soothing, healthy, and delicious Japanese miso glass noodle soup!
