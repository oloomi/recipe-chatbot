This rich sauce combines a medley of ingredients, including chili peppers, chocolate, nuts, and spices, creating a complex, layered flavor perfect for vegan dishes.\n\n### Vegan Mole Poblano\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 4 dried guajillo chiles\n- 2 dried ancho chiles\n- 2 dried pasilla chiles\n- 1 small dried chipotle chile (optional for smokiness)\n- 1/4 cup sesame seeds\n- 1/4 cup unsalted raw almonds\n- 1/4 cup unsalted raw peanuts\n- 1 small plantain, sliced\n- 1 large onion, chopped\n- 4 cloves garlic\n- 2 ripe tomatoes, chopped\n- 1 banana (for sweetness)\n- 2 teaspoons cumin seeds\n- 1 teaspoon cinnamon\n- 1/2 teaspoon cloves\n- 2 tablespoons dark chocolate (vegan, at least 70%)\n- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n- 2 tablespoons raisins\n- 1 tablespoon cacao powder (optional, for depth)\n- 1 teaspoon dried thyme\n- 1 teaspoon dried oregano\n- Salt and black pepper to taste\n- 2 cups vegetable broth\n- Fresh cilantro for garnish\n\n---\n\n### Instructions:\n\n#### Step 1: Prepare the Dried Chiles\n1. **De-stem and de-seed** the dried chiles to reduce heat and bitterness.\n2. **Toast the chiles lightly** in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 1-2 minutes, turning frequently to bring out their aroma. Be careful not to burn them.\n3. **Soak the toasted chiles** in hot water for 15-20 minutes until softened.\n4. Once softened, **drain the chiles**, reserving the soaking water.\n\n#### Step 2: Toast and Grind the Seeds & Nuts\n1. In the same skillet, **toast sesame seeds**, almonds, and peanuts until golden, about 2-3 minutes.\n2. Remove from heat and **let cool**.\n3. **Grind** the toasted seeds and nuts in a blender or spice grinder until finely ground. Set aside.\n\n#### Step 3: Saut\u00e9 Aromatics & Vegetables\n1. In a large skillet, **heat 1 tablespoon of oil** over medium heat.\n2. Add chopped **onion** and **garlic**, saut\u00e9 until translucent and fragrant, about 5 minutes.\n3. Add chopped fresh **tomatoes** and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.\n4. Add the **plantain slices** and cook until they start caramelizing, about 5 minutes.\n\n#### Step 4: Roast & Blend the Chili Mixture\n1. Combine the soaked chiles, toasted seeds/nuts, **cinnamon**, **cloves**, **cumin seeds**, **dried thyme**, **oregano**, **raisin**, and **banana** into a blender.\n2. Add the saut\u00e9ed vegetables from the skillet.\n3. Pour in 1/2 cup of the **reserved soaking water** from the chiles.\n4. Blend until **smooth**. If necessary, add more soaking water or vegetable broth to achieve a thick but pourable consistency.\n\n#### Step 5: Cook the Mole Sauce\n1. In the same skillet, **heat another tablespoon of oil** over medium heat.\n2. Pour the blended sauce into the skillet. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 15-20 minutes, allowing flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken.\n3. Stir in **dark vegan chocolate**, let it melt completely into the sauce.\n4. Taste and adjust salt and pepper as needed.\n\n#### Step 6: Final Touches\n1. If desired, stir in **cacao powder** to deepen the chocolate flavor.\n2. For a smoky flavor, you can add the **chipotle chile** during blending or saut\u00e9ing.\n3. Let the sauce simmer gently for another 5 minutes.\n\n#### Step 7: Serve\n- Traditionally served over **vegan chicken substitutes** or **tofu**.\n- Garnish with fresh **cilantro** and an extra sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds.\n- Enjoy with warm **corn tortillas** or rice.\n\n---\n\nThis mole sauce is a labor of love, rich with layers of flavor and traditional Mexican spices. It pairs beautifully with plant-based proteins or vegetables! Would you like a suggestion on what to serve it with or a vegan protein option?"
