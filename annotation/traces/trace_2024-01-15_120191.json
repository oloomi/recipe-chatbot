This is a traditional Mexican dish that involves complex flavors, multiple steps, and takes all day to perfect. The process combines rich, smoky mole sauce with tender, handmade vegan tamales, offering a true culinary adventure.\n\n### Vegan Mole Poblano with Tamales\n\n#### Ingredients:\n\n**For the Mole Sauce:**\n- 4 dried ancho chilies\n- 2 dried guajillo chilies\n- 2 dried pasilla chilies\n- 1 small onion, chopped\n- 3 cloves garlic\n- 1 plantain, sliced\n- 1/4 cup sliced almonds\n- 1/4 cup raisins\n- 2 tbsp pumpkin seeds\n- 1 tbsp sesame seeds\n- 1 tsp cumin seeds\n- 1 tsp cinnamon\n- 2 tbsp tomato paste\n- 2 tbsp dark chocolate vegan, chopped\n- 2 cups vegetable broth\n- 2 tbsp olive oil\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**For the Tamales:**\n- 3 cups corn masa harina\n- 1 1/2 cups vegetable broth\n- 1/2 cup coconut oil or vegetable shortening\n- 1 tsp baking powder\n- 1 tsp salt\n- 1 cup cooked fillings (such as saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, shredded jackfruit, or vegan cheese)\n- Dried corn husks, soaked in warm water for 30 minutes\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step Instructions:\n\n#### 1. Prepare the Dried Chilies:\n- Remove stems and seeds from the dried chilies.\n- Toast them lightly in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 2-3 minutes until fragrant.\n- Place the toasted chilies in a bowl, cover with hot water, and soak for about 20 minutes until softened.\n\n#### 2. Make the Mole Sauce:\n- Drain the chilies, reserving the soaking water.\n- In a blender, combine the rehydrated chilies, onion, garlic, sliced plantain, almonds, raisins, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, cumin, cinnamon, tomato paste, and chopped vegan chocolate.\n- Add 1 cup of the soaking water or vegetable broth and blend until smooth. You may need to do this in batches.\n- Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.\n- Pour the blended mixture into the pan, cooking and stirring constantly for about 10 minutes until it thickens slightly.\n- Gradually add the remaining vegetable broth, stirring well.\n- Lower the heat and let it simmer gently for 1-2 hours, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\n#### 3. Prepare the Tamale Dough:\n- In a large bowl, combine the corn masa harina, baking powder, and salt.\n- Add the coconut oil or vegan shortening, mixing until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.\n- Slowly pour in the vegetable broth, kneading the dough until smooth and pliable. It should be moist but not sticky.\n\n#### 4. Prepare the Fillings:\n- Saut\u00e9 your chosen fillings (mushrooms, jackfruit, etc.) with spices and a touch of salt. Set aside.\n\n#### 5. Assemble the Tamales:\n- Drain the soaked corn husks.\n- Spread a thin layer of masa dough on the smooth side of each husk.\n- Place a spoonful of your prepared filling in the center.\n- Fold the sides of the husk in, then fold the bottom up and tie if needed to seal.\n\n#### 6. Steam the Tamales:\n- Arrange the assembled tamales standing upright in a large steamer basket.\n- Cover with a damp cloth, then place the lid on top.\n- Steam over boiling water for about 1 hour, checking occasionally to ensure there\u2019s always steam.\n- The tamales are ready when the masa easily pulls away from the husks.\n\n#### 7. Serve:\n- Remove the tamales from the steamer.\n- Serve hot, topped with the rich vegan mole sauce.\n\n---\n\nThis dish involves soaking, blending, simmering, and steaming, making it a rewarding project that will fill your day\u2014and your kitchen\u2014with incredible smells and flavors. Would you like tips on any specific part of the process or alternative fillings?"
