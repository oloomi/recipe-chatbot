It's a classic, sophisticated dish that requires patience, precision, and multiple skillful steps \u2014 perfect for a culinary challenge. Plus, it's soy-free if you choose ingredients carefully. Here\u2019s a detailed recipe to guide you:\n\n---\n\n### Homemade Beef Wellington\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n*For the Beef:*\n- 2 lb (900 g) center-cut beef tenderloin (filet mignon), trimmed\n- Salt and freshly ground black pepper\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard (check label for soy ingredients)\n\n*For the Duxelles:*\n- 1 lb (450 g) mushrooms (such as cremini or button), finely chopped\n- 2 shallots, finely chopped\n- 2 garlic cloves, minced\n- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- 2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves\n\n*For Assembly:*\n- 8-10 slices of prosciutto or Parma ham\n- 1 sheet puff pastry (preferably all-butter, check ingredients for soy-free)\n- 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)\n- Fresh thyme sprigs for garnish\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions:\n\n**1. Prepare the Beef:**\n- **Sear the Tenderloin:** Pat the beef dry with paper towels. Season generously with salt and pepper. In a hot skillet over medium-high heat, add olive oil. When shimmering, sear the beef on all sides until browned, about 2-3 minutes per side. This enhances flavor and texture.\n- **Cool and Mustard:** Transfer the beef to a plate. Allow to cool slightly, then brush all over with Dijon mustard. This adds depth of flavor and helps other layers adhere.\n\n**2. Make the Duxelles:**\n- **Cook the Mushrooms:** In the same skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add chopped mushrooms, shallots, garlic, salt, pepper, and thyme. Cook, stirring often, until the mixture is dark, dry, and fragrant, about 15-20 minutes. This concentrates the flavors and removes excess moisture.\n- **Cool:** Transfer the duxelles to a bowl and let cool.\n\n**3. Assemble the Wrapped Beef:**\n- **Wrap with Prosciutto:** Lay out plastic wrap on a flat surface. Arrange slices of prosciutto slightly overlapping into a rectangle. Spread the cooled duxelles evenly over the prosciutto.\n- **Wrap the Beef:** Place the beef at the edge closest to you, then use the plastic wrap to roll the prosciutto around the beef tightly. Twist the ends of the plastic to secure. Chill in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes.\n  \n**4. Prepare the Puff Pastry:**\n- **Wrap the Beef:** Roll out the puff pastry slightly if needed. Remove the plastic from the beef wrap, then place the beef at the center of the pastry. Fold the pastry over, sealing all edges, and trim any excess. Ensure the seal is tight.\n- **Decorate & Vent:** You can cut decorative shapes from leftover pastry to place on top for elegance. Cut small slits into the top of the pastry to allow steam to escape.\n\n**5. Bake:**\n- **Preheat Oven:** to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n- **Egg Wash:** Brush the whole pastry with beaten egg for a shiny, golden finish.\n- **Bake:** Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for about 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and crisp.\n- **Rest:** Let the Wellington rest for 10 minutes before slicing. This allows juices to redistribute.\n\n**6. Serve:**\n- Slice thickly with a side of roasted vegetables or your favorite greens. Garnish with fresh thyme sprigs.\n\n---\n\n### Tips:\n- Use high-quality beef tenderloin for the best results.\n- Make the duxelles in advance to deepen flavors.\n- Keep the puff pastry cold to prevent it from becoming soggy and to keep it easier to handle.\n- If you prefer, you can also add a layer of foie gras or p\u00e2t\u00e9 beneath the duxelles, but for soy-free considerations, be sure to select suitable ingredients.\n\n---\n\nWould you like a complementary sauce idea or perhaps a different cuisine for a more complex dish?"
