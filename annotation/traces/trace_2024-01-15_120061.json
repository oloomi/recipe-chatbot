Open it like a book.\n2. **Season:** Lightly season inside and outside with salt and black pepper.\n3. **Stuff:** In a small bowl, mix chopped basil, parsley, garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes. Divide this herb mixture evenly among the chicken breasts, stuffing it into each pocket.\n4. **Seal:** Use toothpicks or kitchen twine to secure the edges, ensuring the filling stays inside during cooking.\n\n#### Step 2: Cook the Chicken\n1. **Sear:** Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the stuffed chicken breasts and sear for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown.\n2. **Bake:** Transfer the skillet to a preheated oven at 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C). Remove from oven and let rest for 5 minutes.\n\n#### Step 3: Make Herb Mashed Potatoes\n1. **Cook potatoes:** Peel and cut potatoes into evenly sized chunks. Place in a pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil over high heat; simmer until potatoes are tender (about 15-20 minutes).\n2. **Mash:** Drain well. Add butter, milk, and chopped chives. Mash until smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\n#### Step 4: Roast the Vegetables\n1. **Prepare:** Toss baby carrots, asparagus, and red bell peppers with olive oil, salt, pepper, and thyme.\n2. **Roast:** Spread on a baking sheet in a single layer. Roast in the oven at 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) for about 15-20 minutes until vegetables are tender and slightly caramelized.\n\n---\n\n### To Serve:\nPlate a generous scoop of herb mashed potatoes, place the stuffed chicken atop, and arrange roasted vegetables on the side. Drizzle with any pan juices or a light herb-infused olive oil, and garnish with extra fresh herbs if desired.\n\n---\n\nThis dish is a beautiful balance of flavors\u2014herbaceous, savory, and tender\u2014perfect for a special dinner that's completely soy-free with an elegant presentation.
