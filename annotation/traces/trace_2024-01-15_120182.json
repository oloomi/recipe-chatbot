In a small bowl, combine garlic-infused olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper.\n2. Place the chicken breasts in a zip-top bag or shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the chicken, ensuring they are well coated.\n3. Seal and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours for more flavor infusion.\n\n#### Step 2: Prepare the Roasted Vegetables\n1. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n2. In a large bowl, toss sliced carrots, parsnips, and zucchini with garlic-infused olive oil, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper.\n3. Spread the vegetables evenly on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n4. Roast in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, turning once, until tender and slightly caramelized.\n\n#### Step 3: Cook the Quinoa\n1. Rinse the quinoa under cold water using a fine sieve to remove any bitterness.\n2. In a saucepan, bring 2 cups of water or low-FODMAP broth to a boil.\n3. Add the rinsed quinoa, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed.\n4. Remove from heat, let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork.\n\n#### Step 4: Prepare the Herb Quinoa Salad\n1. While the quinoa cooks, chop parsley, chives, and mint finely.\n2. In a small bowl, whisk together lemon juice, garlic-infused olive oil, and a pinch of salt.\n3. Once the quinoa is cooked and cooled slightly, transfer to a large mixing bowl.\n4. Add the chopped herbs and dressing. Toss to combine.\n\n#### Step 5: Cook the Chicken\n1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat.\n2. Remove chicken breasts from marinade, letting excess drip off.\n3. Add a tablespoon of garlic-infused olive oil to the skillet.\n4. Cook the chicken for about 6-7 minutes per side, or until fully cooked (internal temperature of 165\u00b0F/75\u00b0C).\n5. Remove from heat, let rest for 5 minutes, then slice.\n\n---\n\n### To Serve:\n- Plate the sliced lemon herb chicken alongside a generous serving of roasted root vegetables.\n- Add a scoop of the herbed quinoa salad for freshness and texture.\n- Garnish with additional lemon wedges and fresh herbs if desired.\n\n---\n\nThis dish is high in flavor, packed with herbs and citrus to brighten your palate, and carefully crafted to remain FODMAP-friendly. Enjoy your cooking adventure! Would you like a different cuisine or a different level of effort next?"
