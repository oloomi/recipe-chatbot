It\u2019s perfect for a cooking challenge and will impress anyone at your table. Here\u2019s a detailed step-by-step guide:\n\n**Beef Bourguignon**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 2 lbs (900g) beef chuck or brisket, cut into 2-inch chunks\n- Salt and freshly ground black pepper\n- 2 tbsp vegetable oil\n- 4 oz (115g) pancetta or smoked bacon, diced\n- 1 large onion, sliced\n- 2 carrots, sliced\n- 3 garlic cloves, minced\n- 2 tbsp tomato paste\n- 2 cups red wine (preferably Burgundy or Pinot Noir)\n- 1 cup beef broth\n- 1 bay leaf\n- 1 tsp thyme (dried or fresh)\n- 8 oz (225g) cremini or white mushrooms, quartered\n- 1 tbsp unsalted butter\n- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)\n- Optional: pearl onions, pearl onions, peeled\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Instructions:\n\n**1. Prepare the Beef:**\n- Pat the beef chunks dry with paper towels; excess moisture can inhibit browning.\n- Season generously with salt and pepper on all sides.\n\n**2. Sear the Beef:**\n- Heat a large, heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or deep skillet over medium-high heat.\n- Add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil.\n- When hot, add beef in batches to avoid overcrowding; sear until deeply browned on all sides (about 4-5 minutes per batch).\n- Transfer browned beef to a plate and set aside.\n\n**3. Cook the Pancetta:**\n- In the same pot, add diced pancetta.\n- Cook over medium heat until crispy and browned, about 3-4 minutes.\n- Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.\n\n**4. Saut\u00e9 Vegetables:**\n- Add sliced onion and carrots to the pot; cook until softened, about 5 minutes.\n- Stir in minced garlic; cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n\n**5. Deglaze and Build Flavor:**\n- Stir in tomato paste; cook for 2 minutes.\n- Pour in red wine to deglaze the pot, scraping up browned bits from the bottom.\n- Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes to reduce slightly.\n\n**6. Cook the Beef:**\n- Return the browned beef and pancetta to the pot.\n- Add beef broth, bay leaf, and thyme.\n- Cover loosely and simmer gently on low heat for about 2 to 2.5 hours, or until beef is tender. Stir occasionally, adding more broth if needed.\n\n**7. Prepare the Mushrooms:**\n- While the beef simmers, saut\u00e9 the mushrooms in a skillet with 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat.\n- Cook until browned, about 5-7 minutes.\n- Once cooked, add mushrooms to the stew during the last 30 minutes of cooking.\n\n**8. Final Touches:**\n- Remove bay leaf.\n- Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.\n- Garnish with chopped fresh parsley.\n\n**9. Serve:**\n- Traditionally served over buttered egg noodles, mashed potatoes, or crusty French bread.\n\n---\n\nThis dish requires patience but rewards you with deep, complex flavors. It\u2019s perfect for a weekend culinary challenge! Would you like a dessert recommendation to go along with it?"
