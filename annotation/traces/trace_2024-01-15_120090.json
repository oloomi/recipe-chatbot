        "content": "Certainly! I recommend making **Zucchini Turkey Parmesan Boats** \u2014 a quick, low-carb Italian-inspired dish that's packed with flavor and easy to prepare.\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 2 large zucchinis\n- 1/2 pound ground turkey\n- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Optional: Italian herbs (basil, oregano), red pepper flakes\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Preheat and Prepare Zucchini:**\n   - Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n   - Wash the zucchinis thoroughly. Using a sharp knife, slice each zucchini lengthwise into halves or thirds, depending on size. Carefully scoop out the center of each zucchini half with a spoon, creating a \u201cboat\u201d with about 1/4-inch thick walls. Keep the scooped-out zucchini flesh for later use.\n\n2. **Cook the Filling:**\n   - Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.\n   - Add the minced garlic and saut\u00e9 for about 30 seconds until fragrant.\n   - Add the ground turkey, breaking it apart with a spoon. Cook until browned and cooked through (about 5-7 minutes).\n   - If you reserved zucchini flesh, chop it finely and add to the skillet. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until tender.\n   - Season with salt, pepper, and optional herbs or red pepper flakes.\n\n3. **Assemble the Boats:**\n   - Place the zucchini halves on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\n   - Spoon the cooked turkey mixture into each zucchini boat, distributing evenly.\n   - Sprinkle the grated Parmesan cheese generously over the top of each filled zucchini.\n\n4. **Bake:**\n   - Bake in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until the zucchini is tender and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.\n\n5. **Serve:**\n   - Let cool slightly before serving. Garnish with additional Parmesan or fresh herbs if desired.\n\nEnjoy your flavorful, low-carb Italian-style zucchini boats! Would you like another recipe?"
