While it\u2019s considered advanced due to its layering of ingredients and techniques, I\u2019ll guide you step-by-step to create an authentic, vegan version that\u2019s perfect for a weekend culinary adventure.\n\n---\n\n### Vegan Mole Poblano\n\n**Servings:** 4-6  \n**Preparation Time:** 2.5 hours\n\n---\n\n### Ingredients:\n\n**For the mole sauce:**\n- 3 dried ancho chiles\n- 3 dried pasilla chiles\n- 2 dried mulato chiles (if available)\n- 1 small onion, chopped\n- 3 cloves garlic\n- 1 ripe plantain, sliced\n- 1/4 cup raisins\n- 1/4 cup almonds, toasted\n- 2 tbsp pumpkin seeds, toasted\n- 2 tbsp sesame seeds\n- 2 tbsp cocoa powder or unsweetened dark chocolate (vegan)\n- 1 tsp cumin seeds\n- 1/2 tsp cinnamon\n- 1/4 tsp cloves\n- 1 small tomato, chopped\n- 2 tbsp vegetable oil\n- 2 cups vegetable broth\n- 1 tbsp molasses or brown sugar\n- 1 tbsp tamarind paste (optional, adds depth)\n- Salt and black pepper to taste\n\n**For the main:**\n- 1 block extra-firm tofu or large portobello mushrooms (for a hearty, meaty texture)\n- Corn tortillas or rice (for serving)\n- Fresh cilantro, chopped (garnish)\n- Sliced radishes or avocado (optional garnishes)\n\n---\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the chiles:**\n   - Remove stems and seeds from the dried chiles.  \n   - Toast them briefly in a dry skillet over medium heat until fragrant (about 1 minute per side).  \n   - Transfer to a bowl and cover with hot water. Let soak for 15-20 minutes until soft. Drain and set aside.\n\n2. **Toast the spices and seeds:**\n   - In a dry skillet, toast cumin seeds until aromatic (about 1 minute).  \n   - Add the toasted seeds to a blender. Also add sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, cloves, cinnamon, and cocoa powder. Blend until finely ground.\n\n3. **Make the chili paste:**\n   - Add soaked chiles, chopped tomato, garlic, onion, plantain, raisins, and 1/2 cup of vegetable broth to the blender.  \n   - Blend until smooth, adding more broth if necessary.\n\n4. **Cook the mole sauce:**\n   - Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  \n   - Pour in the blended chili mixture; cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.  \n   - Add remaining broth, molasses, tamarind paste, salt, and pepper.  \n   - Lower heat and simmer gently for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened and flavorful.\n\n5. **Prepare the protein:**\n   - While the mole simmers, prepare your tofu or portobello mushrooms.  \n   - For tofu: press out excess water, cut into cubes, and sear in a skillet with a little oil until golden brown on all sides.  \n   - For portobellos: clean and slice thickly, then saut\u00e9 or grill until tender.\n\n6. **Assemble and serve:**\n   - Warm serving plates.  \n   - Place tofu or mushrooms on the plate, spoon generous amounts of mole sauce over them.  \n   - Garnish with chopped cilantro, and optionally with sliced radishes or avocado.  \n   - Serve alongside warm corn tortillas or steamed rice.\n\n---\n\n### Tips:\n- You can make the sauce a day ahead; flavors improve overnight.\n- For extra richness, add a splash of plant-based cream or coconut milk when simmering the sauce.\n\n---\n\nEnjoy this rich, complex vegan mole\u2014a true celebration of Mexican flavors!
