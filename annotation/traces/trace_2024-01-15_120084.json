        "content": "A fantastic challenging yet achievable gluten-free Indian dish you can prepare in around 30-60 minutes is **Dal Makhani (Slow-Cooked Lentil Stew)** adapted for quicker preparation without sacrificing flavor. Traditionally slow-cooked, this version uses pressure cooking for efficiency, and employs gluten-free ingredients. It's rich, spicy, and perfect if you're looking to master a flavorful Indian classic.\n\n### Ingredients:\n\n- 1 cup whole urad dal (black gram dal), soaked for 1-2 hours\n- 1/4 cup rajma (kidney beans), soaked for 1-2 hours (optional but adds richness)\n- 1 large onion, finely chopped\n- 2 medium tomatoes, pureed\n- 4-5 garlic cloves, minced\n- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated\n- 2 green chilies, slit (adjust to taste)\n- 2 tbsp ghee or oil\n- 1 tsp cumin seeds\n- 1 tsp garam masala\n- 1 tsp coriander powder\n- 1/2 tsp turmeric powder\n- 1/2 tsp red chili powder (adjust)\n- Salt to taste\n- Fresh cilantro for garnish\n- Water or vegetable broth\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Lentils and Beans:**\n   - Drain the soaked urad dal and rajma. Rinse thoroughly.\n   \n2. **Cook the Lentils:**\n   - In a pressure cooker, add the urad dal, rajma, 4 cups of water, a pinch of salt, and any optional spices like a bay leaf or a small cinnamon stick if desired.\n   - Pressure cook for about 15-20 minutes or until the beans are soft but not mushy. Let the pressure release naturally.\n   \n3. **Prepare the Masala:**\n   - While the lentils are cooking, heat ghee or oil in a large pan over medium heat.\n   - Add cumin seeds; once they start to splutter, add the chopped onions and cook until golden brown, about 8-10 minutes.\n   - Add the minced garlic, grated ginger, and slit green chilies. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until fragrant.\n   - Pour in the pureed tomatoes along with coriander powder, turmeric, red chili powder, and garam masala.\n   - Cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, until the oil begins to separate from the masala, about 10 minutes.\n   \n4. **Combine and Simmer:**\n   - Once the lentils are cooked, add the masala to the pressure cooker or transfer everything to the pan if using a large pot.\n   - Mix well, ensuring the lentils are coated with the spice mixture.\n   - Add additional water or broth to reach your desired consistency.\n   - Simmer uncovered on low heat for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. If needed, mash some lentils with the back of a spoon for creaminess.\n   \n5. **Final Touches:**\n   - Taste and adjust salt and spices.\n   - Garnish with freshly chopped cilantro.\n   \n6. **Serve:**\n   - Enjoy hot with gluten-free flatbreads like makki di roti or steamed rice.\n\nThis dish is hearty and bursting with flavor, and mastering it will give you a deeper appreciation of Indian dals.
