        "content": "Great choice! I recommend trying a **Mexican Stuffed Bell Peppers** recipe. It's flavorful, low in carbs, and can be prepared in about 45 minutes. Here's how to make it:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 4 large bell peppers (any color)\n- 1 lb ground turkey or chicken (or beef if preferred)\n- 1 small onion, finely chopped\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes, drained\n- 1 cup cauliflower rice (or make your own by pulsing cauliflower florets in a food processor)\n- 1 teaspoon chili powder\n- 1 teaspoon cumin\n- 1/2 teaspoon paprika\n- 1/2 teaspoon oregano\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- 1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar, Monterey Jack, or Mexican blend)\n- Fresh cilantro for garnish\n- Optional: sliced jalape\u00f1os, sour cream, or avocado for serving\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Preheat the oven:** Set your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n\n2. **Prepare the peppers:** Cut the tops off the bell peppers and carefully remove the seeds and membranes. Rinse and set aside.\n\n3. **Cook the filling:**\n   - In a large skillet over medium heat, add a tablespoon of oil.\n   - Saut\u00e9 the chopped onion until translucent, about 3-4 minutes.\n   - Add the minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds until fragrant.\n   - Add the ground turkey (or chicken/beef) to the skillet. Cook, breaking it apart with a spatula, until browned and cooked through, about 8-10 minutes.\n   - Stir in the diced tomatoes, cauliflower rice, chili powder, cumin, paprika, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook for another 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the cauliflower rice to soften.\n\n4. **Stuff the peppers:**\n   - Place the hollowed-out peppers in a baking dish.\n   - Spoon the cooked filling into each pepper, pressing down slightly.\n   - Sprinkle shredded cheese generously on top of each stuffed pepper.\n\n5. **Bake:**\n   - Cover the dish with foil and bake for 30 minutes.\n   - Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.\n\n6. **Serve:**\n   - Garnish with fresh cilantro.\n   - Add optional sliced jalape\u00f1os, a dollop of sour cream, or avocado slices if desired.\n\nEnjoy your delicious, low-carb Mexican stuffed peppers! They are hearty, flavorful, and perfect for a quick dinner. Would you like more recipe ideas or tips?"
