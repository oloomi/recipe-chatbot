Turn occasionally to get an even char.\n   - Place the peppers in a sealed plastic bag or covered bowl to steam for about 10 minutes. This makes peeling easier.\n   - Once cooled, gently peel off the charred skin, being careful not to tear the peppers. Make a small slit along the side and carefully remove the seeds inside. Keep the peppers intact.\n\n2. **Make the Picadillo:**\n   - In a skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat.\n   - Add the chopped onion and minced garlic; saut\u00e9 until translucent, about 3-4 minutes.\n   - Add the ground meat, if using, and cook until browned.\n   - Stir in the chopped tomatoes, apple, raisins, cinnamon, and cumin. Cook for about 10 minutes, allowing flavors to meld. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n   - Remove from heat and set aside.\n\n3. **Stuff the Peppers:**\n   - Gently open each poblano slit and fill with the picadillo. Be careful not to overstuff.\n\n4. **Prepare the Nut-Free Nogada Sauce:**\n   - In a blender, combine the cooked pumpkin, milk, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, sugar, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt.\n   - Blend until smooth and creamy. Adjust sweetness or cinnamon to taste.\n\n5. **Assemble the Dish:**\n   - Place the stuffed poblano peppers on a serving plate.\n   - Spoon the walnut (pumpkin) sauce generously over the peppers.\n   - Garnish with fresh pomegranate seeds and chopped parsley for a burst of color and flavor.\n\n6. **Serve:**\n   - Enjoy this festive, challenging dish with rice or warm tortillas on the side!\n\n---\n\nThis dish combines savory, sweet, and spicy elements\u2014a true celebration of Mexican cuisine. Take your time and enjoy the process! Would you like a simpler variation or a different festive Mexican dish?"
