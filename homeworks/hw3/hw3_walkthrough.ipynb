    "> 💡 **What's an LLM judge?** Instead of manually reviewing every bot response, we prompt another LLM to do it for us. (No model fine-tuning required—just a well-crafted prompt with examples.) But first, we need human-labeled examples to teach the judge what \"good\" and \"bad\" look like.\n",

    "- A user query with a dietary restriction\n",
    "- The bot's response (a recipe)\n",

    "### Use the HTML Viewer\n",
    "\n",
    "Open `reference_files/trace_viewer.html` in your browser and upload the JSONL file. This lets you:\n",
    "- Navigate between traces with arrow keys\n",
    "- See the query, response, and label for each trace\n",
    "- Understand what PASS vs FAIL looks like\n",
